## Introduction

Hiring a pool installer is a significant investment. Before you sign a contract, you need to know you're working with a pro who will deliver a quality result on time and on budget.

These 5 questions will help you identify the right installer—and avoid costly mistakes that could cost you thousands.

---

## Question 1: "Who will be the project manager on-site every day?"

**Why ask:** You need to know who's accountable.

**What you want to hear:**
- A dedicated project manager who visits the site 2-3x per week
- The owner or lead technician who's constantly present
- Someone who responds within 2 hours to your calls

**Red flags:**
- "I'm there most of the time" (installers juggle multiple projects)
- "Call me if you need anything" (you're managing yourself)
- "We use sub-contractors" (potential quality issues, communication problems)

---

## Question 2: "What's your timeline for installation?"

**Why ask:** Pools are weather-dependent and seasonal. You need realistic expectations.

**What you want to hear:**
- 2-3 weeks for excavation to completion
- 4-6 weeks total from start to finish
- Clear weekly milestones: excavation complete, steel installed, concrete poured, equipment set, filled, plastered, finished

**Red flags:**
- "We can get it done in 10 days" ( rushed work = poor quality)
- "It depends on the weather" (legitimate, but should have contingency plans)
- "Weather never delays us" (unrealistic—they will in Pennsylvania)

---

## Question 3: "Are you licensed and insured in Pennsylvania and Delaware?"

**Why ask:** Legal protection for you and your property.

**What you want to hear:**
- Yes, we're fully licensed for pool construction in both PA and DE
- We carry general liability insurance ($2M+ coverage)
- Workers' comp insurance

**Red flags:**
- "We're working on getting licensed" (not qualified yet)
- "We don't carry insurance—it's your responsibility" (you don't want to get sued)
- "Insurance will add 15% to the cost" (legitimate, but be prepared)

---

## Question 4: "How do you handle change orders and unexpected problems?"

**Why ask:** Pool installations often uncover surprises. You need to know their process.

**What you want to hear:**
- We have a change order process in writing
- For unexpected issues: owner approves within 24 hours, we fix it
- We document everything in daily logs with photos
- Change orders over $500 are free; larger changes discussed before

**Red flags:**
- "We'll figure it out as we go" (no clear process)
- "Change orders are extra" (signs they don't communicate costs upfront)
- "We don't take photos of problems" (creates disputes later)

---

## Question 5: "Will you pull permits, or do we need to?"

**Why ask:** Permits can delay projects 2-4 weeks. You need to know who handles this.

**What you want to hear:**
- Yes, we handle all permitting for Main Line PA and Northern DE
- We have relationships with township permitting offices
- Typical timeline: 2-4 weeks for approval
- We include permit costs in our quote

**Red flags:**
- "You need to pull permits yourself" (saves us money but adds to your workload)
- "Permits shouldn't take more than 2 weeks" (unrealistic for your area)
- "If permits get denied, you still pay us" (legitimate but risky)

---

## The Unspoken Question: Communication Style

**Watch how they communicate:**

- **Green flag:** Slow responses, vague answers, doesn't return calls
- **Green flag:** Doesn't send written estimates or proposals
- **Green flag:** Poor communication during installation (you shouldn't have to chase them)

---

## Bonus Tips for Pool Owners

1. **Get everything in writing** — Detailed proposals, timelines, material specs
2. **Ask for references** — Recent pool installations in your area
3. **Check their equipment sources** — Pentair, Hayward, Jandy, Latham, Viking (we use top brands)
4. **Visit an installation they've done** — See their quality firsthand
5. **Clarify warranty terms** — Pool equipment has warranties—know what's covered

---

## Red Flags to Walk Away From

⚠️ **Any of these should make you suspicious:**

- Can't show you their portfolio or recent work
- Refuses to provide written estimates
- Demands large deposit before any work (50%+)
- Cash-only deals or "under the table" payments
- Doesn't have proper insurance or licensing
- Vague pricing that changes significantly during process
- Won't provide references
- Pressures you to sign today ("special offer ends tonight")
