# Manufacturer Application Trade References - What We Need & Why

**To:** Bryce (Tri-State pool installation contact)
**From:** Brandon Bot

---

## Background

Tri-State Aquatic Solutions is applying to become authorized dealers for pool equipment manufacturers (Pentair, Hayward, Jandy, Latham, Viking). These applications require **trade references** - recommendations from other pool companies who can vouch for Tri-State's construction quality and reliability.

---

## What Are Trade References?

**A trade reference is a professional recommendation from another company in the pool industry that states:**
> "Tri-State Aquatic Solutions has been professional, reliable, and produces high-quality work on our projects. We're confident they would be an excellent authorized dealer."

**Manufacturers require this because:**
- You're a new business (Tri-State just launched)
- They need assurance you have the skills and experience to deliver quality installations
- They want to know you won't disappear or go out of business mid-project
- They want to verify you have relationships with reliable equipment suppliers
- They want to see you're financially stable and insured

**What trade references include:**
- Company name and contact info
- Duration of business relationship (how long you've worked with them)
- Nature of projects completed together
- Quality assessment of workmanship and professionalism
- Reliability (did you show up on time? Communication?)
- Recommendation of your business practices

## Why Tri-State Needs Them

Tri-State is a NEW pool installation business (launched recently). Manufacturers don't know us yet. They need **third-party validation** that proves:

### 1. We're Real & Reliable
"We've completed X pool projects for [Company Name] over the past [number] years. Their work quality is excellent and they've always been professional. We highly recommend Tri-State Aquatic Solutions."

### 2. We're Skilled & Experienced
"Tri-State has [X] years combined pool construction experience. They understand pool installations, equipment, and chemistry. They know how to handle challenges that arise."

### 3. We're Financially Stable
"Tri-State is financially sound and properly insured. We have no concerns about their ability to complete projects or meet obligations."

### 4. We Have Relationships
"We've worked with Tri-State on other projects and they're great partners to work with."

## Why Pool Cleaning Dude Isn't Enough

You're probably thinking: "I already have Pool Cleaning Dude as a reference - that should be enough, right?"

**Here's why it's NOT sufficient:**

### Different Lines of Business
- **Pool Cleaning Dude:** Maintenance service only (recurring cleaning)
- **Tri-State Aquatic Solutions:** New construction installations (digging, concrete, equipment, plastering)

Manufacturers want references specifically for **pool CONSTRUCTION and INSTALLATION** work, not maintenance services.

### Experience Gap
- Pool Cleaning Dude is a maintenance company, not a pool installer
- They don't install equipment, do plumbing, electrical work, or structural pool builds
- Manufacturers won't see them as a credible reference for POOL INSTALLATIONS

## What We Need From Bryce (3 References)

For Tri-State to qualify for manufacturer programs, we need references from **3 different companies** that can vouch for Tri-State's construction capabilities.

### Why 3 references?

**Manufacturers typically require 3-5 references.** Having 3 shows you have relationships with multiple suppliers and aren't dependent on a single relationship.

### What the 3 references should cover:

#### 1. Pool Equipment Suppliers
**Best if:**
- Supply stores where you've purchased pool equipment
- Pool builders who sold you equipment
- Pool service companies who've recommended your work

**What they should say about Tri-State:**
"Tri-State has been our customer for [X] years. They purchase equipment from us regularly and always pay on time. Their installations are professionally completed and their team is respectful of our properties. I strongly recommend Tri-State for pool construction projects."

---

#### 2. Recent Pool Construction Projects
**Best if:**
- Recent residential pool builds you've completed in the last 2-3 years
- Commercial pool projects you've done
- Any property owners who've recommended your work

**What they should say about Tri-State:**
"Tri-State completed our pool installation at [Address] in [Month Year]. The project included [equipment used, any challenges overcome, final budget]. Their team was professional, the work was high quality, and they completed on schedule. I'd be happy to work with them again."

---

#### 3. Related Industry Contacts (Optional but Helpful)
**Best if:**
- Landscape architects who've designed pool projects
- General contractors who've worked on-site during builds
- Electricians or plumbers who've done pool equipment connections

**What they should say about Tri-State:**
"Tri-State coordinated well with our subcontractors on [Project Name]. They communicated clearly, managed the schedule professionally, and the project was a success. We'd recommend Tri-State for integrated pool construction projects."

## How Bryce Can Provide These

Here are options for Bryce to provide the 3 trade references:

### Option 1: Use Pool Cleaning Dude + 2 New References (Fastest)
- Pool Cleaning Dude: "Tri-State has worked with us for maintenance on pool cleaning for 2 years. Always professional, reliable."
- Reference 2: Recent pool customer
- Reference 3: Another industry contact

**Pros:** Bryce can provide 2 immediately (PCD + 1 new)

### Option 2: Professional or Industry Contacts (Most Credible)
- Architect who designed a Tri-State project
- General contractor who worked with Tri-State
- Pool equipment supplier

**Pros:** All 3 are from construction/installation context

### Option 3: Character References
- Former employers in pool industry who can vouch for work ethic
- Colleagues from other pool companies
- Business partners with relevant experience

**Pros:** Personal credibility from people who know Tri-State's team

## What to Tell Bryce

"Bryce, Tri-State needs  submit manufacturer applications and they're asking for 3 trade references. This is standard industry requirement.

**We have 1 reference already:** Pool Cleaning Dude (our maintenance provider) can vouch for our professionalism and reliability over 2 years.

**We need 2 more references** from companies that can speak to Tri-State's pool CONSTRUCTION and INSTALLATION capabilities - not maintenance work.

**Please provide 3 references:**
1. Pool Cleaning Dude (we already have their info)
2. A recent pool construction customer or industry contact
3. A professional contact from the pool industry

**If you only have 1-2 references available:** We can still proceed with applications, but having 3 would significantly strengthen Tri-State's qualification.

---

## The Ask

**Bryce, please provide 3 trade references for Tri-State's manufacturer applications:**

1. **One from Pool Cleaning Dude** (maintenance work)
2. **Two from pool construction/installation** (projects, suppliers, industry contacts)

The references should include:
- Company name
- Contact person and phone/email
- Duration of relationship
- Nature of projects completed together
- Quality assessment (professionalism, reliability)
- Recommendation statement

**Optional:** Include project addresses or brief descriptions of work done together to strengthen credibility.
