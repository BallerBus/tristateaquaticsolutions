# REVISED 30-Day Plan: First Deposits for Pool Installation
## Tri-State Aquatic Solutions - Pool Installation Launch

**Goal**: Collect deposits from customers for spring/summer pool installations
**Timeline**: 30 days (revised from 15 based on council feedback)
**Target**: 2-4 signed contracts with deposits
**Expected Deposits**: $40,000-$90,000

---

## Why 30 Days Instead of 15?

Based on AI council review, critical bottlenecks make 15 days unrealistic:

1. **Insurance requirements**: Manufacturers require $2M liability coverage (takes 5-10 business days)
2. **Dealer approval**: 2-3 weeks from initial contact to approval
3. **Customer expectations**: Affluent buyers expect professional documentation, site evaluations, and time to decide
4. **Permit timeline**: PA pools require permits with 2-4 week processing

**The 30-day plan protects your reputation** in a market where word-of-mouth and referrals from your existing maintenance base will drive long-term revenue.

## RISK MITIGATION

### If Manufacturer Approval is Delayed

- Draft proposals "pending final supplier confirmation"
- Focus on building pipeline for when approval comes through

### If Insurance Takes Longer Than Expected
- Follow up daily with agent
- Ask about expedited processing
- Continue all non-customer-facing preparation

### If Leads Are Slow
- Increase personal outreach to existing customers
- Offer to do a "backyard assessment" for any maintenance customer
- Consider small Facebook/Instagram boost ($100-200)

### If Permit Timelines Are Long
- Include permit timeline clearly in all proposals
- Offer "permit monitoring" as a service
- Set customer expectations upfront

---

## LONG-TERM SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Quality over speed**: Rushing damages reputation in affluent markets
2. **Document everything**: Photos, contracts, change orders
3. **Exceed expectations**: Under-promise, over-deliver on timeline
4. **Follow up relentlessly**: 80% of sales happen after the 5th follow-up
5. **Ask for referrals**: Every happy customer should generate 1-2 referrals
6. **Partner deeply**: 5 great partners > 20 casual contacts
