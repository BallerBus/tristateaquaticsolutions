## 1. Response Strategies by Competitor Action

### Pricing Actions

#### Competitor Launches Major Price Promotion

**Scenario:** Competitor offers 20%+ discount or aggressive pricing

**Assessment Questions:**
- Is this a permanent price reduction or limited promotion?
- What's their margin situation (desperation or strategy)?
- Which customer segment is being targeted?
- How long can they sustain this?

**Response Options:**

| Option | When to Use | Execution | Risk Level |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Value Reinforcement** | Strong brand equity | Emphasize quality, warranty, service | Low |
| **Selective Match** | Specific competitive deals only | Match on quoted jobs in head-to-head | Medium |
| **Bundle Enhancement** | Need to compete on price | Add value (upgrades, service) instead of discounting | Low |
| **Financing Counter** | Price-sensitive market | Better financing terms vs. discount | Low |
| **Ignore** | Small competitor, limited reach | Continue current strategy | Low |
| **Full Price Match** | Market share defense critical | Last resort only | High |

**DO NOT:**
- Enter a price war with better-capitalized competitors
- Discount core offerings without adding value
- Publicly disparage competitor pricing

**Messaging Template:**
> "While others may offer discounts, we focus on delivering lasting value. Our [specific feature] and [specific benefit] mean you're investing in a pool that will bring joy for decades, not cutting corners that lead to costly repairs."

> "While national chains process you through a system, we design your pool around your family. Local decisions mean faster responses and designs that fit your property - not a template that fits their sales quota."

#### vs. Low-Cost Competitors
> "Your pool is a 20-year investment. We use premium materials and experienced craftsmen because we know the difference shows up years later - when the cheaper option needs expensive repairs."

#### vs. Service-Only Companies (Expanding to Building)
> "Pool building requires specialized expertise developed over decades. Our design team and craftsmen have built hundreds of custom pools - we're not learning on your project."
