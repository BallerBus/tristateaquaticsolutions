## ARTICLE 4: RETENTION GUARANTEE AND ADJUSTMENTS

**4.1 Baseline Customer Count.** The baseline for calculating customer retention shall be the total number of Transferred Customers listed in Exhibit A as of the Transition Date.

(b) Equipment problems that existed before the Transition Date and were not disclosed;
