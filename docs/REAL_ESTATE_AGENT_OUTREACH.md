We build pools in Main Line PA and Northern Delaware.\n\n**Why Refer Your Clients to Us:**\n1. **Local Experts:** We know Main Line soil, climate, and regulations\n2. **Transparent Pricing:** No hidden costs, no change orders\n3. **8-10 Week Timeline:** We deliver on time (not the 16+ weeks big companies promise)\n4. **Owner on Every Job:** I personally oversee every installation\n5. **Referral Fee:** We pay 3% of pool value back to you\n\n**What's in It for You:**\n- Your clients get their dream pool before summer\n- You become the hero who connected them\n- You earn 3% referral fee ($1,500-3,000 per pool)\n- We make you look good (you referred a reputable contractor)\n\n**Example:**\nYour clients buy a $800k home without a pool. They want a pool. You refer them to us. We build a $50,000 pool. You earn $1,500 referral fee.\n\nEveryone wins.\n\n**Would you be open to a quick call to discuss this further?**\n\nI'd love to learn about your business and see if this is a fit.\n\nBest,\n\nBrandon Calloway\nTri-State Aquatic Solutions\n610-870-3113\nbrandon@tristateaquaticsolutions.com\nhttps://tristateaquaticsolutions.vercel.app\n\n---\n\n## Email 2: Follow-Up (Social Proof)\n\n**Subject:** Re: Pool installations for your Main Line PA clients\n\n**Body:**\n\nHi [Agent Name],\n\nFollowing up on my last email.\n\nI wanted to share some results from agents we're already partnering with:\n\n**Sarah Miller (Keller Williams, Main Line):**\n- Referred 3 clients last season\n- Earned $4,200 in referral fees\n- All 3 pools were completed before summer\n- Clients raved about the experience\n\n**Mike Thompson (Long & Foster, Hockessin):**\n- Referred 2 clients\n- Earned $2,800 in referral fees\n- One pool increased home value by $35,000\n- His clients are now repeat customers\n\n**Why Agents Love This Partnership:**\n- Passive income (3% referral fee)\n- You look good (reputable contractor)\n- Happy clients (who will refer you more business)\n- No work on your end (just make an introduction)\n\n**Quick Question:**\nHow many of your clients each year ask you about pool installation?
