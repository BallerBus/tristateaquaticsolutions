## The Tri-State Aquatic Solutions Difference

### Boutique Plunge & Garden Pool Specialists

We focus on what we do best: premium fiberglass plunge pools, cocktail pools, and garden pools.

Whether you want a cold plunge for wellness, a cocktail pool for entertaining, or a garden pool that transforms your backyard, we are the region's dedicated specialists.

### 1. Local Expertise, Premium Results

**We know Main Line PA and Northern Delaware.**

We understand the soil conditions, the municipal codes, the architectural styles, and the expectations of homeowners in this area. Every pool we design accounts for the specific character of your neighborhood and your property.

Based in Hockessin, Delaware, we serve communities across Chester County, Delaware County, Montgomery County, and New Castle County. We are your neighbors, not a national franchise.

---

### 2. Transparent Pricing

**Your quote is your quote.**

Every line item is explained upfront -- excavation, pool shell, equipment, plumbing, electrical, decking, and permits. No change orders. No surprises halfway through. We believe trust starts with honesty about what your investment includes.

---

### 3. Owner Involvement on Every Project

**You work directly with our leadership team.**

Brandon Calloway, our Founder and President, brings over a decade of corporate project management experience (JPMorgan, DuPont) and PMP certification to every engagement. Bryce, our Pool Operations Director, oversees all field operations with hands-on expertise in pool installation, maintenance, and equipment.

When you call Tri-State, you get the people who run the company.

---

### 4. Fast, Clean Installation

**2-4 weeks from groundbreaking to your first swim.**

Pre-manufactured fiberglass pools arrive factory-built and are set by crane in a single day. No months of on-site construction. No endless disruption to your daily life. Our streamlined 8-step process is designed for speed and precision without sacrificing quality.

---

### 5. Premium Equipment & Materials

**We select the best so you enjoy the best.**

Pentair pumps. Hayward heaters. Jandy automation. Paired with premium fiberglass pool shells from Latham Pools and Thursday Pools, your installation is built with components chosen for longevity, efficiency, and performance.

---

### 6. Lower Lifetime Cost of Ownership

**Fiberglass pools are an intelligent investment.**

The smooth gelcoat surface resists algae and staining, requiring fewer chemicals and less maintenance than concrete alternatives. No liner replacements. No resurfacing for decades. Many owners save thousands over the life of their pool.

---

### 7. Clear Communication Throughout

**You will always know what is happening.**

- Progress updates with photos at every stage
- A single point of contact for questions and scheduling
- Responsive communication by phone, text, or email
- No disappearing. No guessing.

---

### 8. Lifetime Partnership

**Our relationship does not end at installation.**

We offer ongoing maintenance, seasonal opening and closing services, equipment repair, and water chemistry support. Tri-State Aquatic Solutions is your pool partner for the long term.
