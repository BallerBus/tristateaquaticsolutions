# Pennsylvania Home Improvement Contractor (HIC) Registration Guide
**Created:** 2026-02-14
**Applies to:** Tri-State Aquatic Solutions

---

## Overview

Pennsylvania's **Home Improvement Consumer Protection Act (HICPA)**, passed in 2008, requires anyone who performs at least **$5,000 worth of home improvements per year** to register with the PA Attorney General's Office. Pool installation and major pool services fall under this requirement.

**This is not optional.** Operating without registration can result in fines, inability to enforce contracts, and legal liability.

## ⚠️ Current System Status (As of Feb 2026)

The PA Attorney General's online registration system was **taken offline due to a cyber incident in August 2025**. As of February 2026:

- **Online registration is NOT available**
- **Paper applications ARE being accepted** — mail in the application with payment
- Completed paper applications receive an acknowledgment letter
- Registration certificates (with number) will be mailed once the system is restored
- **Grace period in effect** for new contractors who started after August 8, 2025 — no penalties for not having a registration number during this period
- The grace period extends **30 days after the system is restored**

**Bottom line:** Submit the paper application NOW. You'll be in the queue and covered by the grace period.
