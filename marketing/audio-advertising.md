[SLIGHT PAUSE]

We specialize in premium fiberglass pools - the modern choice that installs in two to four weeks instead of six months. Lower maintenance. Smoother surface. Built to last decades in Pennsylvania's freeze-thaw climate.

Serving the Main Line, Chester County, and Northern Delaware with the kind of personal service that big companies have forgotten how to give.

### Version B - "The Smart Investment" (Value-focused)

**[0:00-1:00]**

*[MUSIC: Sophisticated, intelligent feel - piano with subtle orchestral elements]*

**VOICE (knowledgeable, trustworthy male):**
"Let's talk about something pool companies don't want to discuss: the real numbers.

A concrete pool takes three to six months to build. Fiberglass? Two to four weeks. That's your whole summer back.

Concrete requires weekly brushing, annual acid washing, and resurfacing every ten to fifteen years - that's another ten to fifteen thousand dollars. Fiberglass maintenance? Maybe fifteen minutes a week. No resurfacing. Ever.

And here's what really matters: studies show a quality pool adds eight to fifteen percent to your home's value in neighborhoods like ours. You're not just buying a pool. You're investing in your property - and your quality of life.

I'm Brandon Calloway with Tri-State Aquatic Solutions. We bring premium fiberglass pool technology to Main Line Pennsylvania and Delaware. Transparent pricing. Personal service from the owner. And pools that pay dividends in memories for decades.

Financing available from just a few hundred dollars a month. Schedule your free consultation: six-one-zero, eight-seven-oh, thirty-one-thirteen. Tri-State Aquatic Solutions - the smart choice for the life you love."

"Okay, so I've been thinking about this a lot - you know how everyone talks about getting a pool 'someday'? Well, I found out something interesting from our friends at Tri-State Aquatic Solutions.

[PAUSE - CHECK NOTES IF NEEDED]

They do fiberglass pools, which - and I didn't know this - install in like two to four WEEKS. Not months. Weeks. So if you started now, you could actually be swimming this summer. My mind was kind of blown.

The owner's name is Brandon Calloway, and here's what I love - he actually answers his own phone. Like, you call the number and you get the guy who runs the company. Try that with the big national pool chains, right?

They serve the Main Line, Chester County, Delaware - basically our whole listening area. Free consultations, transparent pricing, no surprise charges.

They're local - Main Line, Delaware, Chester County. And they do free consultations where they'll actually walk your property and tell you what's possible.

They serve the Main Line, Chester County, and Northern Delaware. Free design consultations, transparent pricing - the quote you get is the price you pay.

## Baked-In vs Dynamic Considerations

### Baked-In Ads (Permanent in Episode)

**Advantages:**
- Feels more authentic and integrated
- Host can personalize naturally
- Doesn't feel like an interruption
- Evergreen messaging builds brand over time

**Best For:**
- Longer sponsorship commitments (3+ months)
- Podcasts with loyal, engaged audiences
- Shows where host authenticity is paramount
- Evergreen content that will be discovered later

**Script Considerations:**
- Avoid specific dates or time-limited offers
- Focus on brand positioning, not promotions
- Use "free consultation" rather than "spring special"
- Include website prominently (more evergreen than phone)

### Dynamic Insertion Ads

**Advantages:**
- Can update messaging seasonally
- Test different CTAs and offers
- Stop/start campaigns quickly
- A/B test different scripts

**Best For:**
- Seasonal urgency campaigns (January-May especially)
- Testing new markets or messaging
- Limited-time promotions
- Podcasts with high download velocity

**Script Considerations:**
- Can include specific offers and deadlines
- Update for seasonal relevance
- Track with unique URLs or promo codes
- More produced/polished audio acceptable

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

**Strategy:**
- Baked-in mid-roll with evergreen brand messaging
- Dynamic pre-roll with seasonal offer/urgency
- Example: "This episode brought to you by... [evergreen]" + "And right now, Tri-State is booking spring installations..." [dynamic]

- **Think:** "A friend sharing an exciting discovery"

### Voice Direction Notes for Talent

**DO:**
- Sound like you're talking to a friend over coffee
- Let the enthusiasm come through naturally
- Pause slightly before key benefits
- Smile when reading - it comes through
- Emphasize "two to four weeks" and "owner"

**DON'T:**
- Sound like a car commercial (aggressive/salesy)
- Rush through the phone number
- Over-emphasize every word
- Sound scripted or robotic
- Use a "radio voice" - be authentic

## Music/SFX Suggestions

### Music Beds by Spot Type

**Brand/Awareness Spots:**
- Style: Modern acoustic with light production
- Instruments: Acoustic guitar, light piano, subtle strings
- Mood: Warm, aspirational, premium but approachable
- Examples: Think Nest/Google Home ads, not luxury car ads
- BPM: 90-110 (relaxed but not sleepy)

**Urgency/Seasonal Spots:**
- Style: Upbeat, energetic, summery
- Instruments: Acoustic guitar, light percussion, maybe ukulele
- Mood: Exciting, active, family fun
- Examples: Think vacation ads, summer beer commercials
- BPM: 110-130 (energetic)

**Testimonial/Trust Spots:**
- Style: Minimal, supportive underscore
- Instruments: Solo piano or light acoustic
- Mood: Sincere, personal, not overproduced
- Examples: Think documentary scoring
- BPM: 70-90 (reflective)

### Sound Effects

**Approved SFX:**
- Water splash (subtle, not cartoonish)
- Children laughing/playing (distant, natural)
- Birds/outdoor ambiance (subtle)
- Light "summery" sounds

**Avoid:**
- Diving board "boing" (cliche)
- Overly cartoonish splashes
- Aggressive electronic swooshes
- Generic "whoosh" transitions

### Music Licensing Notes
- Use royalty-free/buyout music for produced spots
- Budget $50-200 per track for quality library music
- Recommended libraries: Artlist, Epidemic Sound, Musicbed
- Ensure broadcast rights included

## Call to Action Best Practices

### Phone Number Presentation

**Preferred Reading:**
"Six-one-zero, eight-seven-oh, thirty-one-thirteen"

**Why:**
- Easier to remember in groups
- "Eight-seven-oh" is distinctive
- "Thirty-one-thirteen" is memorable

**Alternative (faster spots):**
"Six-ten, eight-seven-oh, three-one-one-three"

### Website Presentation

**Preferred Reading:**
"tri-state-aquatic-solutions-dot-com"

**Why:**
- Hyphenated reading aids spelling
- Clear, no ambiguity

**Do NOT say:**
- "Visit us online at..."
- "Go to our website..."
- Just say the URL directly

### Phone vs Website Priority

| Spot Length | Primary CTA | Secondary CTA |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| :15 | Phone OR website (not both) | None |
| :30 | Phone | Website mention if time |
| :60 | Both, phone emphasized | Website for "more info" |
| Live reads | Phone (more personal) | Website |

### Best Practices

**For Phone:**
- Read twice in :60 spots
- Read slower than normal copy
- Consider "That's six-one-zero..." intro

**For Website:**
- Consider vanity URL (see below)
- Always spell out "dot-com"
- Don't combine with phone in short spots

---

## Vanity URL Recommendations

### Current Website
tristateaquaticsolutions.com (long but clear)

### Recommended Vanity URLs for Radio

4. **Example redirect:**
   - tsaswims.com -> tristateaquaticsolutions.com/?utm_source=radio&utm_medium=audio&utm_campaign=vanity

### Recommended Setup

**Primary radio URL:** tsaswims.com
- "T-S-A-Swims-dot-com" reads cleanly
- Short enough for :15 spots
- Memorable, action-oriented

**Tracking URLs by channel:**
- Radio: tsaswims.com (-> ?utm_source=radio)
