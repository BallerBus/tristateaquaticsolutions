## You've Got a Pool in Delco. Now What?

If you own a pool in Delaware County, you already know the drill: winter cover comes off, something looks green, and you're Googling "pool opening service near me" while hoping for the best.

Here's the good news — a professional pool opening isn't complicated, doesn't cost a fortune, and saves you a weekend of backbreaking work. Here's exactly what to expect and what it'll run you in 2026.

## What a Professional Pool Opening Actually Includes

Not every pool company does the same thing. A proper pool opening — the kind where you can actually swim within 48 hours — should include all of this:

**Cover Removal & Cleaning**
- Water pumped off the winter cover
- Cover carefully removed, cleaned, and folded for storage
- Debris cleared from the pool surface

**Equipment Startup**
- Drain plugs reinstalled on pump, filter, heater, and return lines
- Skimmer baskets and return fittings put back in place
- Pump primed and started
- Filter inspected and started (backwash if needed)
- Heater checked for startup readiness

**Water Balancing**
- Water level adjusted (usually needs topping off after winter)
- Chemical shock treatment applied
- pH, alkalinity, and chlorine tested and balanced
- Clarifier added if water is cloudy

**Safety Inspection**
- Equipment checked for visible leaks, cracks, or damage
- Electrical connections inspected
- Pool area assessed for safety hazards (loose coping, broken ladders, etc.)

If your pool company doesn't do all of this, you're not getting a full opening — you're getting a cover removal with a handshake.

## How Much Does a Pool Opening Cost in Delaware County?

Let's talk numbers. For a standard in-ground pool in Delaware County, PA, here's what you're looking at in 2026:

| Pool Type | Typical Cost |
|-----------|-------------|
| Standard in-ground (up to 20K gallons) | $250 – $350 |
| Large in-ground (20K+ gallons) | $350 – $450 |
| Above-ground pool | $150 – $250 |
| Add-on: safety cover removal | +$50 – $100 |
| Add-on: full chemical package | +$75 – $125 |

**What affects the price:**

- **Pool size** — More water means more chemicals and more time
- **Cover type** — Mesh covers are faster; solid covers need water pumped off first
- **Condition** — A well-winterized pool opens in 2 hours. A neglected one takes half a day.
- **Add-ons** — Some companies charge extra for chemicals, filter cleaning, or equipment repairs

**Pro tip:** The cheapest pool opening isn't always the best deal. A $175 "opening" that skips the chemical balance means you're buying $100 in chemicals yourself and spending your Saturday testing water every two hours. Pay for the full service once and be done with it.

## How to Choose a Pool Opening Service Near You

Delaware County has no shortage of guys with a truck and a pool net. Here's how to find someone who actually knows what they're doing:

### 1. Check PA HIC Registration
Pennsylvania requires any contractor doing $500+ in work to be registered with the Home Improvement Contractor program. If they can't give you a registration number, walk away. It's the law — and it protects you.

### 2. Insurance Matters
Pool work involves water, electricity, and expensive equipment. Make sure they carry general liability insurance. If something goes wrong on your property, you don't want to be the one paying.

### 3. Read Local Reviews
Check Google reviews specifically from Delaware County customers. A company might be great in Bucks County but have no presence in your area. Local matters for response time and familiarity with your neighborhood's common pool types.

### 4. Ask About Ongoing Maintenance
The best pool companies don't just open your pool and disappear. Ask if they offer weekly or bi-weekly maintenance plans. Having the same team that opened your pool handle the summer maintenance means they already know your equipment, your water chemistry tendencies, and your pool's quirks.
