## Your Printable Spring Pool Prep Checklist

Winter is ending. The snow is melting. And somewhere under that pool cover, your summer fun is waiting.

But before you dive in, there's work to do. Skip these steps and you're looking at green water, broken equipment, and a delayed swim season. Do them right — or hire someone who will — and you'll be swimming by Memorial Day weekend.

This checklist is designed specifically for pool owners in **Pennsylvania and Delaware**. Our freeze-thaw cycles, pollen seasons, and short summers mean we can't treat pool prep like they do in Florida or California.

Print this out. Check off each item. Your future self will thank you.

## 6 Weeks Before Opening (Early to Mid-March)

The ground is still frozen. Your pool is still hibernating. But now is when smart pool owners start preparing.

### ☐ Book Your Professional Pool Opening

**This is the #1 most important item on this list.**

Good pool companies on the Main Line and in Delaware County book up fast. By mid-April, the best dates are gone. By May, you're swimming in June.

**Action:** Call your pool service now. Ask about early bird pricing (many offer 10% off for February/March bookings).

### ☐ Order Replacement Chemicals and Test Strips

Don't wait until opening day to discover you're out of shock treatment or your test strips expired last August.

**Stock up on:**
- Chlorine shock (liquid or granular)
- pH increaser and decreaser
- Alkalinity increaser
- Test strips or liquid test kit
- Algaecide (preventative)
- Clarifier

**Pro tip:** Many pool stores offer "spring opening kits" with everything you need. Just make sure it's sized for your pool volume.

### ☐ Inspect Your Winter Cover for Damage

Walk around your pool and look at the cover:

- **Tears or holes?** Patch them now before debris gets in
- **Water pooling?** Pump it off — standing water damages covers and breeds mosquitoes
- **Straps secure?** Winter wind loosens anchoring systems
- **Debris buildup?** Clear leaves and branches (heavy loads damage covers)

**Cost of neglect:** A damaged cover that lets in sunlight and debris can turn your clear winter water into a green swamp — adding $300–$600 to your opening costs.

### ☐ Check Pool Deck for Winter Damage

Pennsylvania winters are brutal on pool decks. Freeze-thaw cycles cause cracking, shifting, and heaving.

**Look for:**
- Cracks in concrete or pavers
- Loose coping stones (the edge around your pool)
- Settling or sinking sections
- Loose or missing expansion joint caulking

**Safety note:** Deck damage isn't just cosmetic. Tripping hazards around a pool are dangerous. Fix cracks before opening day.

## 4 Weeks Before Opening (Late March)

Spring is arriving. Daytime temps are hitting 50°F. It's time to get serious about prep.

### ☐ Schedule Equipment Inspection

Your pump, filter, and heater have been sitting idle for 4–6 months. Before you try to start everything on opening day, have a pro check:

- **Pump:** Seals, gaskets, motor condition
- **Filter:** Cartridge condition or sand replacement needs
- **Heater:** Burner condition, heat exchanger, gas connections
- **Electrical:** GFCI outlets, timer boxes, connection points

**Why it matters:** Starting a pump with a bad seal can burn out the motor ($800–$1,500 replacement). Finding the problem now saves money.

### ☐ Check for Visible Plumbing Leaks

Before the system is pressurized, do a visual inspection:

- Look under the pool (if accessible) for wet spots
- Check equipment pad for signs of leakage
- Inspect visible plumbing lines for cracks

**Note:** Some leaks only show up when the system is running. This is just a preliminary check.

### ☐ Clean the Area Around the Pool

Winter leaves debris everywhere. Before opening:

- Trim tree branches hanging over the pool
- Clear leaves and debris from the pool perimeter
- Remove any items stored near the pool over winter
- Check that fence gates swing freely

**Benefit:** Less debris falling in during opening = clearer water faster.

### ☐ Review Your Homeowner's Insurance

Make sure your policy covers your pool. Key things to verify:

- Is the pool specifically listed?
- What's your liability coverage limit?
- Are there any pool-related exclusions?
- Do you need additional umbrella coverage?

**Reality check:** A pool-related injury lawsuit can exceed $500,000. Make sure you're covered.

## 2 Weeks Before Opening (Mid-April)

The weather is warming. Pollen is falling. It's almost time.

### ☐ Remove and Clean Winter Cover

When daytime temps are consistently above 60°F and nighttime lows stay above 40°F, it's time:

1. Pump off standing water (don't let it dump into the pool)
2. Remove debris from cover surface
3. Have 2–3 people help remove the cover (don't drag debris into the pool)
4. Lay cover out on grass or driveway
5. Clean with mild soap and soft brush
6. Let dry completely
7. Fold and store in a cool, dry place

**Warning:** Removing a cover alone can damage it — or dump weeks of rotting leaves into your pool. Get help.

### ☐ Reinstall Drain Plugs and Return Fittings

Your pool was winterized with plugs in the returns and skimmer. Now it's time to reverse that:

- Remove winterization plugs from returns
- Reinstall eyeball fittings on returns
- Remove skimmer plugs/bottles
- Reinstall skimmer baskets
- Check that drain covers are secure

**Double-check:** Make sure all plugs are removed before starting the pump. Running a pump with closed returns = broken equipment.

### ☐ Fill Pool to Proper Water Level

Winter evaporation and cover pumping lower water levels. Before starting equipment:

- Fill pool to middle of skimmer opening
- Use a garden hose (city water is usually balanced for pools)
- If using well water, test for metals (copper, iron) that stain pools

**Time estimate:** Filling a standard pool takes 12–24 hours. Plan accordingly.

### ☐ Prime and Start the Pump

The moment of truth:

1. Make sure pump basket is clean
2. Open all valves to allow water flow
3. Fill pump basket with water (priming)
4. Seal pump lid tightly
5. Turn on pump
6. Check for leaks at pump, filter, and heater
7. Verify water is flowing through returns

**If the pump won't prime:** You have an air leak somewhere. Common culprits are loose pump lid or dried-out O-rings.

## Opening Week (Late April to Early May)

Your pool is running. Now make it swimmable.

### ☐ Shock the Pool

Even if the water looks clear, it needs a spring shock:

- Use 2–3 lbs of calcium hypochlorite shock per 10,000 gallons
- Add in evening (sunlight degrades chlorine)
- Brush pool to distribute
- Run pump overnight

**Expected result:** Water may cloud up for 12–24 hours. This is normal — it's the shock killing winter algae.

### ☐ Run Filter 24 Hours

Don't skimp on this. After shocking:

- Keep pump running continuously for 24 hours
- Check filter pressure every 4–6 hours
- Backwash or clean filter if pressure rises 8–10 PSI above baseline

**Why 24 hours?** The shock needs time to kill everything. The filter needs time to remove it. Shortcuts = green water.

### ☐ Test and Balance Chemicals

Once the water clears, test everything:

| Parameter | Ideal Range |
|-----------|-------------|
| pH | 7.2 – 7.6 |
| Free Chlorine | 1 – 3 ppm |
| Total Alkalinity | 80 – 120 ppm |
| Calcium Hardness | 200 – 400 ppm |
| Cyanuric Acid | 30 – 50 ppm |

**Adjust in this order:** Alkalinity first, then pH, then calcium, then chlorine. Making adjustments out of order causes chemical "chasing."

### ☐ Inspect Safety Equipment

Before anyone swims:

- **Fence:** Gates latch properly? Self-closing mechanism works?
- **Gate alarms:** Test them
- **Pool alarm:** If required by your township, make sure it's working
- **Rescue equipment:** Shepherd's hook, life ring, first aid kit accessible?
- **Drain covers:** VGB-compliant and secure?

**Legal note:** Pennsylvania and Delaware both require pool barriers. Non-compliance can result in fines and liability issues.

### ☐ Clean Tile Line and Skimmer Baskets

Finish strong:

- Scrub tile line with pool tile cleaner
- Empty and rinse skimmer baskets
- Skim surface for any remaining debris
- Brush pool walls and floor

**Now step back and admire:** Your pool is ready for summer.

## Pro Tip: Why Most Pool Owners Hire a Professional for Opening

This checklist is comprehensive — and exhausting. Here's why 80% of pool owners on the Main Line hire professionals like us:

**Equipment mistakes are expensive**  
A $15 gasket installed wrong can destroy a $1,200 pump. We've seen it.

**Chemical balance is tricky after winter**  
Winter water chemistry is different. Getting it wrong means algae, cloudy water, or skin irritation.

**A pro spots problems you'd miss**  
Hairline cracks in plaster. Early-stage gasket wear. Electrical connections that are starting to corrode. We catch these before they become expensive.

**Your time is worth something**  
DIY opening: 6–10 hours of physical work.  
Professional opening: You make one phone call.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I open my pool myself and just hire you for maintenance?**  
A: Absolutely. Many DIYers open their own pools, then sign up for weekly service to keep it easy all summer.

**Q: What if my pool is already green?**  
A: Call us immediately. The longer you wait, the worse it gets. We can turn most green pools clear within 3–5 days.

**Q: Do you offer chemical-only opening packages?**  
A: Yes — if you handle the physical work (cover, plugs, equipment startup), we can come balance the chemistry and inspect everything.

**Q: How soon after opening can I swim?**  
A: Once water is balanced and chlorine is below 5 ppm — usually 2–3 days after a professional opening.

**Q: What if we get a late freeze after opening?**  
A: Keep the pump running continuously during freezing weather. Moving water won't freeze. Most PA pool owners don't worry about this after early May.
