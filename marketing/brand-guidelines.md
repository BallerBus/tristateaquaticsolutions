### 3. Excellence
Premium results require premium commitment. We use only quality materials from trusted manufacturers, employ skilled craftspeople, and refuse to cut corners. Every detail matters.

### 4. Innovation
Modern fiberglass pool technology enables faster installation, lower maintenance, and superior results. We embrace innovation that benefits our customers while maintaining traditional values of craftsmanship.

## FAQ Responses

### Installation & Timeline

**Q: How long does pool installation take?**

A: Our fiberglass pool installations typically take 2-4 weeks from groundbreaking to swimming, compared to 4-6 months for traditional concrete pools. The total project timeline, including design, permitting, and preparation, is usually 8-12 weeks. We provide a detailed timeline specific to your project at your design consultation.

You receive weekly updates throughout, and Brandon is on-site for key milestones.

---

**Q: When is the best time to install a pool?**

A: We install pools year-round in the Delaware Valley region. Spring installations (March-May) are swim-ready for summer. Fall installations (September-November) take advantage of lower demand and position you for the following season. Planning typically begins 2-3 months before desired start date, so contact us early to secure your preferred timeline.

### Pricing & Value

**Q: How much does a pool cost?**

A: Fiberglass pool installations typically range from $40,000-$100,000+ depending on size, features, and site conditions. Small pools (12'x20' - 14'x28') generally run $40,000-$55,000. Medium pools (15'x30' - 16'x32') are typically $55,000-$75,000. We provide detailed, itemized quotes with fixed pricing - the price we quote is the price you pay.

---

**Q: Are there hidden costs?**

A: No. Our quotes are comprehensive and itemized. We list every component, material brand, and specification. We do not use "allowances" that can increase later. If site conditions require additional work, we identify this during our initial assessment, not after signing.

---

**Q: Why should I invest in a pool?**

A: A well-designed pool delivers lifestyle benefits (family time, entertaining, wellness), adds property value (5-7% average increase), and creates lasting memories. Our fiberglass pools also offer 50% lower lifetime maintenance costs than concrete, making them an intelligent long-term investment.

### Quality & Materials

**Q: Why fiberglass instead of concrete?**

A: Fiberglass pools deliver luxury results with significant advantages: faster installation (2-4 weeks vs. 4-6 months), 50% lower lifetime maintenance, smooth non-porous surfaces that resist algae, and no resurfacing requirements. Today's fiberglass technology offers extensive customization while respecting your time and budget. We are happy to discuss which option best suits your specific needs.

---

**Q: What equipment brands do you use?**

A: We partner with industry-leading manufacturers including Pentair, Hayward, and Jandy for pumps, filters, heaters, and automation systems. Every component is specified by brand in your contract - we never substitute without your approval.
