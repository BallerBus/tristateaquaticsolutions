# TriState Aquatic Solutions — Brand Voice Guide
**Created:** 2026-02-19
**Purpose:** Ensure consistent tone across all marketing channels
**Applies to:** Social media, website, email, ads, direct mail, sales materials

---

## Brand Personality (3 Words)

**Professional. Local. Reliable.**

We're not the cheapest pool company. We're the one that shows up, does it right, and makes pool ownership actually enjoyable.

---

## Voice Attributes

### 1. Professional (Not Stuffy)
✅ "We'll handle your pool opening from cover to chemicals."
❌ "We provide comprehensive aquatic solutions utilizing industry-best methodologies."

We know pools inside and out. We communicate that expertise without sounding like a textbook. Use simple words. Short sentences.

### 2. Local (Not Corporate)
✅ "Hey, it's Brandon. I answer the phone."
❌ "TriState Aquatic Solutions is pleased to serve the tri-state area."

We're owner-operated. Not a franchise. Not a call center. Brandon and Bryce ARE the company. Use first person ("we," "our," "us"). Reference local places (Main Line, Hockessin, Cherry Hill). Talk like a neighbor who happens to be really good with pools.

### 3. Reliable (Not Flaky)
✅ "We show up when we say we will. Wild concept, we know."
❌ "We strive to provide timely service to all our valued customers."

Pool companies have a reputation for ghosting customers. We don't. Our reliability is a differentiator. Be direct about it. A little humor is okay — the frustration is real.

## Tone Guidelines by Channel

### Social Media (Instagram/Facebook)
- **Tone:** Friendly, helpful, seasonal
- **Length:** Short posts (2-4 sentences). Longer only for educational content.

## Words We Use (And Don't Use)

### ✅ Say This
- Pool opening (not "pool start-up")
- Weekly maintenance (not "service plan")
- Free assessment (not "complimentary evaluation")
- Local / Owner-operated / Family-owned
- Reliable / On-time / Professional
- Main Line / Delaware / New Jersey (be specific)
- "We" (not "the company")

### ❌ Avoid This
- "Solutions" (overused, vague)
- "Provider" (corporate)
- "Value-added" (buzzword)
- "Leverage" (not how normal people talk)
- "Synergy" (ever)
- Industry jargon ("flow rate," "chloramine levels" — unless educating)
- Fake urgency ("Act now!" "Limited time!!!")
