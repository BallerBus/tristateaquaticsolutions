```

---

## 1.2 Inquiry Response Flows

### General Inquiry

*User: "I'm interested in getting a pool"*

```
That's exciting, [NAME]! I'd love to help.

A few quick questions to point you in the right direction:

1. Where are you located? (Main Line PA, Chester County, Delaware?)
2. Do you have a sense of when you'd want to be swimming?
3. Have you thought about fiberglass vs other pool types?

No wrong answers - just helps me understand your situation!
```

---

### Pricing Inquiry

*User: "How much do your pools cost?"*

```
Great question - I appreciate directness!

Here's the honest range for our area:

**Fiberglass Pools:**
• Small (12x24): $45K-$55K
• Medium (14x30): $55K-$70K
• Large (16x36): $70K-$90K

**Plunge Pools:**
• $35K-$50K

These include installation, permits, and standard features.

Every property is different though. For an accurate number, a free site visit is the best next step.

Want to schedule one?
```

---

### Photo/Gallery Request

*User: "Can I see examples of your work?"*

```
Absolutely! Here's where you can check out our work:

🔗 [Link to website gallery]

Or I can send you a few right here - any specific style you're looking for? Modern, classic, plunge pools...?
```

*If they specify, send 2-3 relevant photos via Messenger*

```
Here are a few [style] pools we've done recently:

[Photo 1] - This one's in [Area], about [size]

[Photo 2] - Love how this one turned out in [Area]

[Photo 3] - [Unique feature about this one]

Any of these close to what you're envisioning?
```

---

### Service Area Inquiry

*User: "Do you service [area]?"*

**If in service area:**
```
Yes! We do a lot of work in [area]. In fact, [mention specific project or detail if possible].

Are you thinking about a pool for your place there?
```

**If outside service area:**
```
Unfortunately [area] is outside our service area. We focus on Main Line PA, Chester County, and Northern Delaware to ensure great service.

For your area, I'd recommend checking:
• Pool & Hot Tub Alliance directory (phta.org)
• HomeAdvisor for local contractors

Sorry I can't help directly!
```

---

### Timeline Inquiry

*User: "How long does installation take?"*

```
Faster than you might expect!

Our fiberglass pools:
• Permits: 2-4 weeks (we handle everything)
• Installation: 2-4 weeks

**Total: About 6-10 weeks from signing to swimming**

Compare that to concrete pools which can take 3-6 months!

When are you hoping to be in the water?
```

---

## 1.3 Lead Qualification Flow

### Step-by-Step Messenger Qualification

**Step 1: Location**
```
To make sure I can help - where's your property located?

• Main Line PA (Wayne, Bryn Mawr, Villanova area)
• Chester County (West Chester, Malvern, Exton)
• Delaware (Hockessin, Wilmington)
• Somewhere else
```

**Step 2: Timeline**
```
Perfect! And when would you ideally like to be enjoying your new pool?

• This summer (let's move fast!)
• Next year
• Just researching for now
```

**Step 3: Pool Type**
```
Are you leaning toward:

• Fiberglass pool (most popular - 2-4 week install)
• Plunge pool (compact luxury)
• Not sure yet - help me decide!
```

**Step 4: Transition to Consultation**
```
Based on what you've shared, I think you'd really benefit from a free site visit. I can see your space, discuss options, and give you accurate pricing.

No pressure, no obligation - just information.

## 1.6 Handling Common Objections via Messenger

### Price Objection

*User: "That's more than I expected"*

```
I hear you - pools are a significant investment.

A few things to consider:
• Our price includes EVERYTHING (excavation, permits, installation)
• Fiberglass has 50% lower lifetime maintenance than concrete
• We offer financing options

What budget were you working with? Let me see if we can find an option that fits better.
```

---

### Timing Objection

*User: "We're not ready yet"*

```
Totally understand! When do you think you might be ready?

Here's why I ask - if you want to swim next summer, you'd ideally start conversations early spring. Planning ahead helps!

Can I check in with you in [timeframe]?
```

---

### Comparison Shopping

*User: "Getting other quotes"*

```
Smart approach! When you're comparing, make sure each quote includes:
• Excavation
• Permits
• Electrical prep
• All the same features

Sometimes "cheaper" quotes have hidden add-ons.

Happy to explain exactly what ours includes if that helps!
```

Great eye! Tanning ledges are super popular.

Good news - with fiberglass pools, tanning ledges are often built right into the shell design. No extra cost for the feature itself!
