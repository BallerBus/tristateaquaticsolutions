# 1. Two-Way Conversation Templates

## 1.1 New Lead Initial Contact

### Lead Response to Website Inquiry

**Trigger:** New lead submits form on website
**Goal:** Establish text communication, qualify, schedule consultation

**Message 1 (Auto-sent immediately):**
```
Hi [NAME]! This is Brandon from Tri-State Aquatic Solutions. Thanks for reaching out about your pool project! I'll call you shortly, but feel free to text me here if that's easier. -Brandon

Reply STOP to opt out
```

**If no phone answer, follow-up:**
```
Hey [NAME], missed you on the phone. Quick question - are you looking at a fiberglass pool, plunge pool, or still deciding? Text back and I can send relevant info your way.
```

**Lead Response Examples & Replies:**

*Lead: "Fiberglass pool"*
```
Great choice! Fiberglass pools install in 2-4 weeks and have 50% lower maintenance than concrete. Are you in the Main Line PA area or Delaware?
```

*Lead: "Not sure yet"*
```
No problem! Quick question - what size backyard are you working with? That'll help me point you to the right options.
```

*Lead: "Just getting prices"*
```
Totally understand! Ballpark: fiberglass pools $45K-90K depending on size, plunge pools $35K-50K. For a real number, I'd need to see your property. Free consultation - interested?
```

---

### Lead Qualification via Text

**Message flow for qualifying leads:**

**Step 1:**
```
Hey [NAME], before I send you info - quick question. Where's your property located? Main Line PA, Chester County, or Delaware?
```

**Step 2 (after location confirmed):**
```
Perfect, we do lots of work there! When are you hoping to be swimming - this summer, next year, or just researching for now?
```

**Step 3 (if timeline is reasonable):**
```
That's doable! Have you thought about a budget range? Just helps me point you to the right options. No pressure if you'd rather discuss on a call.
```

**Step 4 (closing to consultation):**
```
Based on what you've shared, a quick site visit would help me give you accurate numbers. Free, no obligation - how's [DAY] look for you?
```

## 1.2 Following Up with Engaged Leads

### 24-Hour Post-Inquiry Follow-Up

**If lead was engaged but didn't schedule:**
```
Hey [NAME], just following up on our chat yesterday. Still interested in exploring pool options? I have some time [DAY] if you want to chat or meet. -Brandon
```

---

### 3-Day Follow-Up

```
Hi [NAME], checking in! Had a chance to think about your pool project? Happy to answer any questions over text or a quick call. -Brandon
```

---

### 7-Day Re-engagement

```
[NAME], it's Brandon from Tri-State Aquatic. We chatted about a week ago. Still on your mind, or has timing changed? Either way, I'm here when you're ready!
```

---

## 1.3 Post-Consultation Follow-Up

### Same Day (Evening)

```
[NAME], great meeting you today! Really excited about what's possible for your backyard. I'll have your proposal ready within [X] days. Any questions before then, just text!
```

Hey [NAME]! Just sent over your pool proposal to [EMAIL]. Take a look when you have a chance. I'm around to discuss whenever works for you.

### 5 Days After Proposal

```
[NAME], following up on your pool quote. Any questions I can answer? If pricing is a concern, we can look at different options or discuss financing.
```

---

## 1.4 Objection Handling via Text

### Pricing Concern

*Lead: "It's more than I expected"*
```
I get it - pools are a big investment. A few thoughts: 1) Our quotes include EVERYTHING (excavation, permits, etc.), 2) We offer financing, 3) We might have smaller options that fit better. Can we chat for 5 min to explore options?
```

---

### Timing Concern

*Lead: "Not sure about timing"*
```
Totally understand. When would be ideal - hoping to swim this summer, next year? I can help you plan backward from your goal to figure out when to start.
```

---

### Comparison Shopping

*Lead: "Getting other quotes"*
```
Smart approach! When comparing, make sure to check what's included - excavation, permits, electrical prep. Some quotes hide costs. Happy to explain ours if helpful.
```

---

### Need to Think About It

*Lead: "Need to think about it"*
```
Of course! Big decision. What specific things are you weighing? Sometimes I can help - no pressure, just want to be useful.
```

---

## 1.5 Closing Conversations via Text

### Accepting Proposal

*Lead: "We're ready to move forward"*
```
That's awesome! I'll call you today to go over next steps and scheduling. What time works best - morning, afternoon, or evening?
```

---

### Declining/Postponing

*Lead: "We decided to wait"*
```
I understand - timing has to be right. When you're ready, we're here. I'll check in down the road unless you'd rather I didn't. Thanks for considering us, [NAME]!
```

---

### Choosing Competitor

*Lead: "We went with another company"*
```
I appreciate you letting me know! Best of luck with your project. If you ever need anything down the road, don't hesitate to reach out. -Brandon
```

# 3. Quick Question Responses

## 3.1 Pricing Questions

### "How much for a pool?"

```
Quick answer: fiberglass pools run $45K-90K depending on size, plunge pools $35K-50K. That includes installation and basic features. For your specific property, I'd need to see it - free consultation. Interested?
```

---

### "Do you have financing?"

```
Yes! We work with financing partners - terms from 5-15 years, rates around 7-9%. Example: $60K pool at 8%/12 years = ~$650/mo. Want me to connect you with our financing partner? No commitment to check rates.
```

---

### "Can you beat [competitor] price?"

```
I can't compete with pricing I haven't seen, but I can make sure you're comparing apples to apples. What's included in their quote? Sometimes the details differ. Happy to review side-by-side.
```

---

## 3.2 Timeline Questions

### "How long does it take?"

```
Fast! Fiberglass pools: 2-4 weeks from start to swim. Add 2-4 weeks for permits. Total: ~6-10 weeks from contract signing. Compare to 3-6 months for concrete!
```

---

### "Can you have it done by [date]?"

**If possible:**
```
That should work! We'd want to get started soon though. When can we schedule a consultation?
```

**If tight:**
```
That's tight, but potentially doable depending on permits. Let's get you on the calendar this week and I'll give you an honest assessment.
```

---

## 3.3 Service Questions

### "Do you do [specific thing]?"

**If yes:**
```
Yes! [Brief explanation]. Want more details, or shall we discuss at a consultation?
```

**If no:**
```
We don't handle that directly, but I can recommend someone reliable. [Recommendation] does great work. Let me know if you need their info.
```

---

### "Do you service my area?"

```
Where are you located? We cover Main Line PA, Chester County, and Northern Delaware. Send me your zip and I'll confirm!
```

---

### "What's included in your quote?"

```
Our quotes are comprehensive - excavation, pool shell/install, plumbing, basic landscaping restoration, permits. Fencing and final electrical typically separate. No surprises!
```

---

## 3.4 Technical Questions

### "Will a pool fit in my yard?"

```
Most yards can work! I'd need to see it to be sure - factors like access, slope, setbacks all matter. Free site visit - want to schedule?
```

---

### "What about my HOA?"

```
We work with HOA communities all the time. We can help prep documents for submission. Do you know what your HOA requires?
```

---

### "Fiberglass vs concrete?"

```
Quick take: Fiberglass - faster install (weeks vs months), lower maintenance, no resurfacing needed. Concrete - unlimited custom shapes but more upkeep. For most homes, fiberglass wins. Want our detailed comparison guide?
```

### "Are you licensed?"

```
Yes! PA Home Improvement Contractor and Delaware registered. Fully insured too. I can send documentation if you need it.
```
