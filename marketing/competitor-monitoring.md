## 5. Competitive Response Playbook

### Response Decision Framework

When a competitor makes a move, use this framework to decide how to respond:

```
Competitor Action
       |
       v
Is it affecting our customers/prospects?
       |
   Yes / No
    |      \
    v       v
Monitor    No immediate action
only       (add to quarterly review)
    |
    v
What type of action?
    |
    +--> Price Move --> See Price Response Protocol
    |
    +--> New Service --> See Service Response Protocol
    |
    +--> Marketing Campaign --> See Marketing Response Protocol
    |
    +--> PR/News --> See PR Response Protocol
```

### Price Response Protocol

**Scenario: Competitor lowers prices**

| Price Drop | Response |
|------------|----------|
| 0-10% | Monitor only, maintain positioning on value |
| 10-20% | Enhance value proposition messaging, consider targeted promotions |
| 20%+ | Investigate (are they struggling? clearing inventory?), prepare talking points |

**Response Options (choose based on situation):**

1. **Hold Position (Default)**
   - Emphasize value over price
   - Highlight quality, warranty, service
   - Let competitor move play out

2. **Match Selectively**
   - Match only for specific customer segments
   - Require competitor quote to match
   - Time-limited offer

3. **Differentiate Further**
   - Add value instead of cutting price
   - Enhanced warranty, faster service, premium materials
   - Bundle offerings

4. **Attack Weakness**
   - If price cut signals desperation
   - Increase marketing emphasizing stability and quality
   - Target competitor's existing customers with service messaging

**Talking Points for Sales Team:**
> "I see [Competitor] is offering lower prices right now. Here's what to keep in mind: with a major investment like a pool, the lowest price is rarely the best value. Our price includes [specific differentiators]. And consider this - when something goes wrong years from now, will that company still be around to help? Will they honor their warranty?"

---

**Scenario: Competitor raises prices**

**Response:**
- Generally, do not follow immediately
- Monitor market response
- Consider raising if market accepts competitor increase
- Use as opportunity to position as better value

---

### New Service Response Protocol

**Scenario: Competitor launches new service/product**

**Assessment Questions:**
1. Is this service/product relevant to our target customers?
2. Can we offer something similar? Should we?
3. Does this expose a gap in our offerings?
4. Is this a distraction from their core business?

**Response Matrix:**

| Service Relevance | Our Capability | Response |
|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| High relevance | Can do now | Fast-follow (30-60 days) |
| High relevance | Cannot do now | Evaluate development vs. partnership |
| Medium relevance | Can do now | Add to roadmap, not urgent |
| Medium relevance | Cannot do now | Monitor adoption |
| Low relevance | Any | No action |

**Fast-Follow Checklist:**
- [ ] Understand the offering (mystery shop, research)
- [ ] Identify our version's differentiators
- [ ] Develop pricing
- [ ] Create marketing materials
- [ ] Train sales team
- [ ] Soft launch to existing customers
- [ ] Full launch

---

### Marketing Campaign Response Protocol

**Scenario: Competitor launches aggressive marketing campaign**

**Assessment:**
1. What channels are they using?
2. What's their message/offer?
3. Is it targeting our customers specifically?
4. What's the estimated spend?

**Response Options:**

| Campaign Type | Response |
|---------------|----------|
| Brand awareness | Continue planned marketing, don't overreact |
| Direct comparison | Address in sales conversations, not marketing |
| Aggressive promotion | Counter-promote if impacting leads, otherwise monitor |
| Geographic expansion | Increase local/hyperlocal marketing |
| Reputation repair | Opportunity - increase review generation |

**Counter-Campaign Guidelines:**
- Don't reference competitor directly
- Focus on our strengths, not their weaknesses
- Maintain brand consistency
- Match channel presence, not messaging style
- Test and measure response

---

### PR/News Response Protocol

**Scenario: Competitor receives positive press**

**Response:**
- Congratulate publicly if appropriate (shows confidence)
- Develop our own PR pitch based on different angle
- Continue planned content calendar
- Don't chase their narrative

**Scenario: Competitor receives negative press**

**Response:**
- **DO NOT** publicly attack or pile on
- **DO NOT** reference in marketing
- **DO** increase positive messaging about our values
- **DO** be prepared for sales conversations
- **DO** focus on review generation to strengthen position

---

### Competitive Response Quick Reference

| Situation | Default Response | Escalate If |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Price decrease | Monitor, hold position | Losing deals citing price |
