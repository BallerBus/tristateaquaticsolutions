### FAQ Document

#### Frequently Asked Questions

**BEFORE INSTALLATION**

**Q: How long does the permit process take?**
A: Permit timelines vary by municipality, typically 2-6 weeks. We handle all applications and will keep you updated on status. Some areas may require additional time for HOA approvals.

**Q: Do I need to be home during installation?**
A: We recommend being available on Day 1 for orientation and on the final day for Pool School. During other days, you don't need to be home, but please ensure our team can access the backyard.

**Q: What if it rains during installation?**
A: Light rain typically doesn't affect fiberglass installation. Heavy rain or storms may cause brief delays. We'll communicate any schedule changes immediately.

**Q: Do I need to mark my utilities?**
A: We coordinate utility marking through 811 as part of our standard process. However, please inform us of any private utilities (septic, irrigation, invisible fences) not covered by 811.

**DURING INSTALLATION**

**Q: How much noise should I expect?**
A: Excavation and concrete work are the loudest phases. We work during normal business hours (7am-6pm) and comply with all local noise ordinances.

**Q: What about my landscaping?**
A: We take care to minimize disruption. Some disturbance near the work area is unavoidable. We'll discuss access routes and protection measures before starting.

**Q: Can I watch the installation?**
A: While we love enthusiastic customers, please maintain a safe distance during heavy equipment operation. We'll provide regular updates and photos.

**Q: What if I have questions during installation?**
A: Your Lead Installer is your on-site contact. For complex questions, they'll connect you with your Project Manager.

**AFTER INSTALLATION**

**Q: When can I swim?**
A: After final inspection approval, Pool School completion, and proper water chemistry balance (usually 24-48 hours after filling), you're ready to swim!

**Q: What chemicals do I need to start?**
A: We provide a starter chemical kit and teach you proper usage during Pool School. Your kit includes everything needed for the first month.

**Q: How often should I test my water?**
A: Test 2-3 times per week during swimming season. Bring a water sample to a local pool store monthly for comprehensive analysis.

**Q: When should I schedule my first maintenance?**
A: We recommend professional maintenance at the 2-week and 1-month marks. After that, quarterly professional service keeps your pool in top shape.

## 5. Pool School (Customer Education)

### Water Chemistry Basics

```
POOL SCHOOL: WATER CHEMISTRY 101
================================

WHY CHEMISTRY MATTERS
---------------------
Proper water chemistry:
- Keeps swimmers safe and comfortable
- Protects your pool surface and equipment
- Prevents algae and bacteria growth
- Saves money on chemicals long-term

THE BIG 5: KEY PARAMETERS
-------------------------

1. pH (7.4 - 7.6)
   What it is: Measures acidity/alkalinity
   Why it matters:
   - Too low: Irritates eyes/skin, corrodes equipment
   - Too high: Reduces chlorine effectiveness, causes scaling
   How to adjust:
   - Raise: Add soda ash
   - Lower: Add muriatic acid or dry acid

2. CHLORINE (2 - 4 ppm)
   What it is: Your primary sanitizer
   Why it matters: Kills bacteria, viruses, algae
   Types:
   - Free chlorine: Available to sanitize (what you measure)
   - Combined chlorine: Used up (causes chloramine smell)
   - Total chlorine: Free + Combined
   How to adjust:
   - Raise: Add liquid chlorine or shock
   - Lower: Let sun degrade naturally

3. TOTAL ALKALINITY (80 - 120 ppm)
   What it is: pH buffer/stabilizer
   Why it matters: Prevents pH from bouncing around
   How to adjust:
   - Raise: Add baking soda
   - Lower: Add muriatic acid (carefully)

4. CALCIUM HARDNESS (200 - 400 ppm)
   What it is: Dissolved calcium in water
   Why it matters:
   - Too low: Water attacks pool surface/grout
   - Too high: Causes scale buildup
   How to adjust:
   - Raise: Add calcium chloride
   - Lower: Partial drain and refill

5. CYANURIC ACID (CYA) (30 - 50 ppm)
   What it is: Chlorine stabilizer/sunscreen
   Why it matters: Protects chlorine from UV degradation
   Note: Only needed for outdoor pools
   How to adjust:
   - Raise: Add stabilizer/conditioner
   - Lower: Partial drain and refill (only way)

TESTING YOUR WATER
------------------

At Home:
- Test strips: Quick, easy, less precise
- Liquid test kits: More accurate, takes practice
- Digital testers: Most accurate, higher cost

Test Frequency:
| Parameter  | How Often      |
|------------|----------------|
| pH         | 2-3x per week  |
| Chlorine   | 2-3x per week  |
| Alkalinity | Weekly         |
| Calcium    | Monthly        |
| CYA        | Monthly        |

Professional Testing:
- Monthly at a pool store (free at most locations)
- They test for additional parameters
- Get a printout for your records

CHEMICAL SAFETY
---------------
- NEVER mix chemicals
- Add chemicals to water, not water to chemicals
- Store in cool, dry, ventilated area
- Keep away from children and pets
- Wear gloves and eye protection
- Wash hands after handling

THE CHEMISTRY RELATIONSHIP
--------------------------
All parameters affect each other:

pH ←→ Chlorine Effectiveness
- At pH 7.2: Chlorine is ~65% effective
- At pH 7.6: Chlorine is ~50% effective
- At pH 8.0: Chlorine is only ~20% effective

Alkalinity ←→ pH Stability
- Low alkalinity = pH swings wildly
- Balanced alkalinity = stable pH

Temperature ←→ Everything
- Warmer water = faster chlorine consumption
- Warmer water = more bacterial growth
- Adjust chemical additions for season

### Troubleshooting Guide

```
POOL SCHOOL: TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
==================================

WATER PROBLEMS
--------------

CLOUDY WATER
Possible Causes:
1. Poor filtration (dirty filter, insufficient runtime)
2. Unbalanced chemistry (high pH, low chlorine)
3. High calcium or TDS
4. Early algae growth

Solutions:
1. Clean/backwash filter, run pump 24 hours
2. Test and balance chemicals, shock if needed
3. Professional water test, partial drain if TDS high
4. Shock heavily, brush, maintain chlorine

GREEN WATER (Algae)
Severity Assessment:
- Light green: Mild algae
- Dark green: Moderate algae
- Black/dark: Severe algae

Treatment:
1. Brush entire pool thoroughly
2. Clean filter
3. Shock based on severity:
   - Mild: 2x normal shock
   - Moderate: 3x normal shock
   - Severe: 4x normal shock
4. Run pump 24/7 until clear
5. Vacuum dead algae to waste
6. Clean filter multiple times
7. Maintain high chlorine (10+ ppm) until clear

Prevention:
- Maintain proper chlorine levels
- Brush weekly
- Clean after storms
- Check phosphate levels

BURNING EYES/STRONG CHLORINE SMELL
Likely Cause: Combined chlorine (chloramines), NOT too much chlorine
Solution: Shock the pool (breakpoint chlorination)
This "burns off" the combined chlorine

STAINING
Metal Stains (rust, brown, green):
- Test for iron, copper, manganese
- Use metal sequestrant
- Balance chemistry
- Consider metal filter

Organic Stains (leaves, berries):
- Brush area
- Apply enzyme treatment
- Shock pool

SCALE (white buildup):
- High calcium hardness
- High pH
- Reduce calcium (partial drain)
- Lower and maintain proper pH
- Use scale inhibitor

EQUIPMENT PROBLEMS
------------------

PUMP NOT PRIMING
Check:
[ ] Water level above skimmer
[ ] Strainer basket lid sealed
[ ] Basket o-ring condition
[ ] Suction valves open
[ ] Air leak in suction line

Try:
1. Fill strainer with water manually
2. Tighten lid
3. Check for cracks in lid
4. Inspect visible pipes for damage

PUMP MAKING NOISE
Humming, not running:
- Capacitor may be bad
- Impeller may be stuck
- Call for service

Grinding/screeching:
- Bearings failing
- Call for service (don't run pump)

Cavitation (loud, intermittent):
- Not getting enough water
- Check for clog in line
- Check water level
- May be sucking air

HEATER NOT HEATING
Check:
[ ] Thermostat set higher than water temp
[ ] Pump running (required for flow)
[ ] Gas supply on (gas heaters)
[ ] Breaker on (electric/heat pump)
[ ] Filter clean (adequate flow needed)

Gas Heater: Check pilot light
Heat Pump: Check airflow, clean coils
Electric: Check breaker, call if tripped repeatedly

FILTER PRESSURE ISSUES
High Pressure (>10 PSI above baseline):
- Dirty filter - clean/backwash
- Clogged returns - check for obstruction
- Valve partially closed

Low Pressure (<5 PSI):
- Clogged pump basket/skimmer
- Air leak on suction side
- Pump issue

SALT SYSTEM LOW/NO CHLORINE
Check:
[ ] Salt level in range
[ ] Cell clean (no scale)
[ ] Output % setting
[ ] Pump running enough hours
[ ] Flow switch working

WHEN TO CALL A PROFESSIONAL
---------------------------

CALL US IMMEDIATELY:
- Major water leak
- Electrical issues (sparking, tripping)
- Gas smell near heater
