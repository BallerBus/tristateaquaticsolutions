## 2. KPI Definitions

### Net Promoter Score (NPS)

**Definition:** Measures customer loyalty and likelihood to recommend.

**Question:** "On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend Tri-State Aquatic Solutions to a friend or colleague?"

**Calculation:**
```
NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors

Where:
- Promoters = responses of 9-10
- Passives = responses of 7-8
- Detractors = responses of 0-6
```

**Example:**
- 100 responses: 60 Promoters, 25 Passives, 15 Detractors
- NPS = 60% - 15% = +45

**Score Interpretation:**
| Score Range | Rating | Action |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| 70+ | Excellent | Maintain and promote |
| 50-69 | Great | Minor improvements |
| 30-49 | Good | Focused improvements |
| 0-29 | Needs Improvement | Significant changes needed |
| Below 0 | Critical | Immediate intervention |

**Target:** 60+ (industry-leading for home services)

---

### Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)

**Definition:** Measures satisfaction with a specific interaction or overall experience.

**Question:** "How satisfied were you with [specific experience]?"

**Scale:** 1-5 stars or Very Dissatisfied to Very Satisfied

**Calculation:**
```
CSAT = (Number of satisfied responses / Total responses) x 100

Where satisfied = 4 or 5 on 5-point scale
```

**Example:**
- 50 responses: 40 rated 4 or 5
- CSAT = (40/50) x 100 = 80%

**Target:** 85%+ overall satisfaction

---

### Customer Effort Score (CES)

**Definition:** Measures how easy it was for customers to work with us.

**Question:** "How easy was it to work with Tri-State Aquatic Solutions?"

**Scale:** 1-7 (1 = Very Difficult, 7 = Very Easy)

**Calculation:**
```
CES = Sum of all scores / Number of responses
```

**Interpretation:**
- 6-7: Low effort (ideal)
- 4-5: Moderate effort (room for improvement)
- 1-3: High effort (significant friction)

**Target:** 6.0+ average

---

### Response Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of customers who complete surveys.

**Calculation:**
```
Response Rate = (Completed surveys / Surveys sent) x 100
```

**Benchmarks:**

- Phone surveys: 50-70% typical

**Target:** 25%+ for email surveys

---

### Review Metrics

```
Average = Sum of all ratings / Number of reviews
```
Target: 4.7+ stars across platforms

**Review Volume:**
