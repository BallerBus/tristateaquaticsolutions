2. **Provide excellent service**
   - The best way to get organic Yelp reviews

3. **Respond to existing reviews**

4. **Claim and optimize your Yelp profile**
   - Complete business information
   - Add high-quality photos
   - Keep hours updated

### Compliant Awareness Message

```
In your email signature or materials:

### Manual High-Touch Approach

1. **Day 10:** Personal phone call from project manager
   - "How's everything going with the pool?"
   - Listen for satisfaction signals
   - If positive: "We'd be honored if you'd share that experience in an online review"

2. **Day 14:** Follow up email with review link

3. **Day 21:** Final reminder (if no review)

### Do NOT Request Reviews From:

- Customers with open complaints
- Customers who had significant project issues
- Customers who seem dissatisfied (even if project is complete)
- Anyone who has opted out of marketing communications
