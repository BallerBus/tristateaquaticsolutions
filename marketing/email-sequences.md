## Email 2: Education + Expertise
**Send:** Day 3

### Subject Line Options:
- **A:** The Question Every Pool Buyer Should Ask First
- **B:** {{FirstName}}, What Most Pool Companies Won't Tell You

### Body:

Hi {{FirstName}},

After helping dozens of Main Line and Northern Delaware families create their backyard retreats, I've noticed something: the happiest pool owners aren't the ones who paid the least or got the biggest pool.

They're the ones who asked the right questions before signing anything.

**The most important question?**

"Who will I communicate with throughout my project, and how do I reach them?"

This single question reveals everything about how a company operates. Will you have one dedicated contact, or be passed between departments? Can you reach a decision-maker, or will you navigate voicemail systems?

At Tri-State, the answer is simple: you communicate with me, the owner, and you have my direct phone number. When you call, I answer.

I've included a complete list of questions to ask any pool builder in your planning guide. Use them with every company you speak with, including us. The answers will make your decision clear.

Have questions about anything in your guide?

## Email 3: Social Proof + Transformation
**Send:** Day 6

### Subject Line Options:
- **A:** See What's Possible in Your Backyard
- **B:** A {{Location}} Family's 3-Week Transformation

### Body:

Hi {{FirstName}},

I wanted to share a recent project that shows what's possible with modern pool technology.

The Williams family in Hockessin had a sloped backyard they'd written off as "unbuildable." They'd been told by two other companies it would require extensive excavation and a 6-month timeline.

We designed a fiberglass pool that worked with their terrain, not against it. Three weeks later, they were swimming.

Their words: "Tri-State made what felt impossible feel effortless. Brandon was on-site constantly, we knew what was happening every step of the way, and the final price matched the quote exactly."

**What made the difference:**

- Custom design for their specific yard conditions
- Fiberglass technology that adapts to terrain
- Dedicated crew from start to finish
- Weekly photo updates and direct owner communication

Every backyard has potential. Sometimes it just takes the right approach to unlock it.

Would you like to see what's possible in your space? Our design consultations include a custom assessment of your property at no cost.

## Email 4: Addressing Concerns
**Send:** Day 10

### Subject Line Options:
- **A:** The Real Cost of Waiting Another Year
- **B:** {{FirstName}}, Is This the Year?

### Body:

Hi {{FirstName}},

Building a pool is a significant decision. It's natural to take time researching, comparing, and making sure you're ready.

But I want to share something I've learned from families who waited years before finally moving forward: most wish they hadn't delayed.

**What they tell me:**

"We spent five summers saying 'maybe next year.' Those are five summers of memories we didn't make."

"We thought we were being careful, but really we were just anxious about a process we didn't understand."

"The cost didn't get lower by waiting. And our kids got five years older."

I'm not suggesting rushing a decision this important. What I am suggesting: if you're interested in enjoying a pool this summer, the window to begin is now.

**The timeline:**

- Design consultation: 1 week
- Custom design and quote: 2 weeks
- Permits: 2-4 weeks
- Installation: 2-4 weeks

Starting in February means swimming by June. Starting in April often means swimming in August, or waiting until next year.

If timing is a factor for you, I'd recommend scheduling a consultation soon, even if you're still deciding. There's no obligation, and you'll have real information to base your decision on.

## Email 5: Value Proposition Deep Dive
**Send:** Day 14

### Subject Line Options:
- **A:** Why Fiberglass? The Numbers Behind the Modern Choice
- **B:** {{FirstName}}, Here's What Premium Really Means

### Body:

Hi {{FirstName}},

You may be wondering why we specialize in fiberglass pools when concrete has been the "traditional" choice for decades.

The answer comes down to math.

**Installation time:**
- Concrete: 3-6 months
- Fiberglass: 2-4 weeks

**Lifetime maintenance:**
- Concrete: Resurfacing every 10-15 years ($10,000+)
- Fiberglass: Smooth gel coat lasts 25+ years

**Chemical costs:**
- Concrete: Porous surface requires more chemicals
- Fiberglass: Non-porous surface needs up to 50% fewer chemicals

**Energy costs:**
- Concrete: Rough surface creates drag, pumps work harder
- Fiberglass: Smooth surface means lower pump energy costs

**Total cost of ownership over 20 years:**
- Concrete: $80,000-$120,000 (including resurfacing)
- Fiberglass: $50,000-$70,000

Fiberglass isn't a budget alternative. It's a smarter investment for homeowners who value their time and want to enjoy their pool rather than maintain it.

**What you get with premium fiberglass:**
- Built-in seating and tanning ledges (standard, not add-ons)
- Designer steps and entry options
- Lifetime structural warranty
- Smooth, comfortable surface

If you'd like to see fiberglass options suited to your yard and budget, I'd welcome the chance to show you what's possible.

## Email 6: Urgency + Scarcity
**Send:** Day 18

### Subject Line Options:
- **A:** Our Spring Installation Schedule is Filling
- **B:** {{FirstName}}, A Quick Update on Availability

### Body:

Hi {{FirstName}},

I wanted to give you a quick update on our schedule.

As a boutique builder with owner involvement on every project, we limit the number of pools we install each season. This ensures every family gets the attention and quality they deserve.

**Current status:**

We have openings for spring installation, but our schedule is filling. Families who begin consultations in the next few weeks will have the best selection of installation dates.

This isn't a pressure tactic. It's simply the reality of working with a small, dedicated team rather than a large corporate operation.

**If a pool is in your plans for 2026:**

A 30-minute consultation will give you:
- Assessment of your backyard's potential
- Understanding of realistic timelines
- Preliminary budget range for your goals
- Answers to any questions you have

No obligation. No high-pressure sales presentation. Just an honest conversation about whether we're the right fit for each other.

If you're ready to take the next step, I have availability this week.

## Email 7: Final Value + Direct Ask
**Send:** Day 21

### Subject Line Options:
- **A:** {{FirstName}}, One Last Thought Before I Go
- **B:** Is There Anything I Can Answer for You?

### Body:

Hi {{FirstName}},

Over the past few weeks, I've shared our approach, our process, and what makes Tri-State different. I hope it's been helpful as you research your options.

I'll keep this final message brief.

**If you're seriously considering a pool:**

The next step is simple: a free design consultation at your home. We'll walk your backyard together, discuss your vision, and I'll give you honest feedback on what's realistic for your space and budget.

No pressure. No obligation. If we're not the right fit, I'll tell you.

**If the timing isn't right:**

No worries at all. Keep this email. When you're ready, whether that's next month or next year, reach out. I'll still be here, building pools for families across the Main Line and Northern Delaware.

**One thing I'd ask:**

If there's something holding you back, a concern, a question, or something that doesn't feel right, would you let me know? I genuinely want to help, and sometimes the best help is simply answering the question you haven't asked yet.

Whatever you decide, I wish you the backyard of your dreams.

Warm regards,

## Email 2: Design Preview + Excitement Building
**Send:** Day 3

### Subject Line Options:
- **A:** {{FirstName}}, Your Design is Coming Together
- **B:** A Sneak Peek at Your Backyard Transformation

### Body:

Hi {{FirstName}},

Quick update: I've been working on your pool design, and I'm excited about where it's heading.

Your backyard has some unique characteristics that we're incorporating into the design. Without giving too much away, I think you'll be pleased with how we're maximizing your space while addressing the [specific feature/challenge discussed].

**While you wait:**

A few families find it helpful to start thinking about:

- **Landscaping vision** - How do you want the area around the pool to feel? We can coordinate with landscapers to create a cohesive design.

- **Usage priorities** - Will this primarily be for family relaxation, entertaining, exercise, or all three? This helps us fine-tune features.

- **Timing preferences** - Are there any dates that matter, like a graduation party or summer gathering you'd love to have poolside?

None of this is required, just food for thought as we finalize your proposal.

Your complete design package will be ready by [specific date]. I'll reach out to schedule a time to review everything together.

## Email 4: Objection Handling + Reassurance
**Send:** Day 10

### Subject Line Options:
- **A:** {{FirstName}}, Any Questions About Your Proposal?
- **B:** Taking Your Time? Completely Understand.

### Body:

Hi {{FirstName}},

I wanted to check in and see if you've had a chance to review your pool design and proposal.

Making a decision like this takes time, and I completely understand. It's a significant investment in your home and family.

**If you're comparing options:**

I'd encourage you to ask every company the same questions:

1. Who is my point of contact, and can I reach them directly?
2. Are all materials specified by brand in the contract?
3. What happens if something needs attention after installation?
4. Is this price final, or should I expect change orders?

The answers will tell you a lot about how you'll be treated as a customer.

**If something in our proposal gave you pause:**

Please tell me. Whether it's the price, a feature, the timeline, or something else entirely, I'd rather have an honest conversation than lose the opportunity to work with you.

Sometimes small adjustments make a big difference. Let's talk about what matters most to you.

**If you're simply not ready:**

That's okay too. I'll be here when the time is right. Just let me know, and I won't keep filling your inbox.

Whatever's on your mind, I'm here to help.

## Email 2: Fresh Value + New Angle
**Send:** Day 8

### Subject Line Options:
- **A:** Something New You Might Like, {{FirstName}}
- **B:** Have You Considered a Plunge Pool?

### Body:

Hi {{FirstName}},

Since we last spoke, I've been thinking about different ways to help families achieve their backyard dreams, even when a full-size pool might not feel right.

**Enter the plunge pool.**

Plunge pools are intentionally compact, 12-14 feet, designed for:
- Smaller backyards with limited space
- Homeowners wanting luxury without extensive maintenance
- Cold plunge wellness routines
- Year-round use with heating options
- Faster installation (as quick as 2 weeks)
- Lower investment starting around $35,000

They're not a compromise. They're a different philosophy: maximum enjoyment in a thoughtfully scaled footprint.

**Why I'm mentioning this:**

Sometimes when families step back from a pool project, it's because the scope felt overwhelming. A plunge pool might be the perfect middle ground.

Or maybe you're still interested in a full-size pool and just needed time. Either way, I'm here.

Would you like to see some plunge pool designs? Or shall we revisit your original vision?

### Subject Line Options:

### Body:

Hi {{FirstName}},

I wanted to share a quick update from your area.

We just completed a beautiful installation for a family in {{Location}}. They reached out around the same time you did, moved forward with their project, and are now enjoying their backyard retreat.

I'm not sharing this to make you feel pressured. I'm sharing it because seeing what's possible sometimes reignites the spark.

**Their feedback after one month of ownership:**

"We use it every single day. Our kids' friends are always over. It's become the gathering place we always wanted our home to be. Our only regret is not doing it sooner."

**If you're wondering "what if":**

Let's have a quick conversation. No commitment, no pressure. Just a check-in to see where you are and whether now might be the right time.

The pool you imagined is still possible. The backyard transformation you pictured can still happen.

When you're ready, I'm here.

Hi {{FirstName}},

But I want you to know: the door is always open.

**If life changes and a pool becomes a priority:**

- Reply to any of my emails
- Call or text me directly: 610-870-3113
- Visit our website and request a consultation

I'll be here, still building pools for families across the Main Line and Northern Delaware, still committed to the same values: honest pricing, owner involvement, and treating every project like it's for a neighbor.

**A final thought:**

The families who work with us often say the same thing: "We wish we'd done this years ago."

I'm not saying that to pressure you. I'm saying it because when the timing is right, you deserve to experience that same joy.

Until then, I wish you and your family all the best.
