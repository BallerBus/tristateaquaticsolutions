It was great meeting you at the [Show Name] this weekend! We had an
incredible time connecting with so many homeowners who are dreaming
of their perfect backyard.

I wanted to make sure you didn't miss your EXCLUSIVE SHOW OFFER:

$2,500 OFF Your Pool Installation
+ FREE LED Lighting Package ($1,500 Value)
Total Savings: $4,000+

Offer expires: [Date - 2 weeks from show]
----------------------------------------

Or call me directly at 610-870-3113

During our consultation, I'll:
- Assess your backyard and discuss your vision

- Provide a detailed, transparent quote
- Answer all your questions about the process

There's absolutely no obligation. Just honest conversation about

### Email 2: Day 4

**Subject:** Quick question about your pool plans, [First Name]

```
Hi [First Name],

I'm following up from the [Show Name] - I hope you had a great time
at the event!

I noticed you stopped by our booth but we haven't had a chance to
chat in detail yet. I'm curious:

What's holding you back from scheduling a free consultation?

Common concerns I hear:
- "I'm not sure if my yard is big enough" - Most are!
- "I don't know if I can afford it" - Financing from $299/month
- "I'm worried about the construction disruption" - Only 2-4 weeks
- "I don't want a pushy sales pitch" - I'm an owner, not a salesman

I'd love to address whatever's on your mind.

Your show special ($4,000+ in savings) expires on [Date]. Even if
you're on the fence, a free consultation gives you real information
to make your decision.

Ready to chat? Here's my calendar: [link]

Or just hit reply and let me know what questions you have.

Brandon
```

### Email 3: Day 7

**Subject:** What [Customer Name] said about working with us

```
Hi [First Name],

I wanted to share what one of our recent customers said after we
completed their pool project:

"Brandon was involved from day one. In a world of big companies,
it was refreshing to work with someone who genuinely cared about
our project. The pool was installed in just 4 weeks, and we were
swimming by Memorial Day."
- The Peterson Family, Gladwyne

Like the Petersons, you could be enjoying your own backyard oasis
this summer.

And with your show special still active, there's no better time
to explore your options:

----------------------------------------
$2,500 OFF Installation
+ FREE LED Lighting ($1,500 Value)
Expires: [Date]
----------------------------------------

Schedule your free consultation: [link]

Or call me: 610-870-3113

What's the worst that can happen? You learn more about what's
possible for your backyard.

Brandon

**Subject:** Last chance: Show offer ends tomorrow

```
Hi [First Name],

This is it - your show special expires tomorrow at midnight.

$2,500 OFF + FREE LED Lighting = $4,000+ savings

After tomorrow, this offer goes away.

If you're still interested in a pool this summer, take 2 minutes
to schedule a consultation: [link]

If the timing isn't right, no worries. I'll keep you on our list
for future updates and seasonal offers.

But if you've been thinking about it... don't let $4,000 slip away.

>> Claim your offer now: [link]

Talk soon,
Brandon

P.S. Even if you schedule for a few weeks out, you'll still lock
in the show pricing. Just book before midnight tomorrow.
```

---

### Email 6: Day 14 (Offer Expired - Soft Close)

**Subject:** Your show offer expired, but...

```
Hi [First Name],

Your exclusive show discount has expired. I hope you don't
mind me reaching out one last time.

While the show special is no longer available, I'm still happy
to offer you a complimentary consultation to explore your options.

We're heading into prime pool planning season. If you're
considering a pool for this summer, now is the time to start
the conversation - permits alone can take 3-4 weeks.

I'd be glad to:
- Visit your property for a free assessment
- Show you what's possible for your backyard
- Provide honest pricing information
- Answer any questions you have

No special offer needed for that.

If you'd like to chat: [link to schedule]

If now isn't the right time, that's okay too. I'll check in
again next season.

Wishing you well,
Brandon
