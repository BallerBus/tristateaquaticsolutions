### Post 2: "From This → To This" Transformation 🔄
**Format:** Before/After carousel (2 slides)
**Caption Length:** Short

**Slide 1:** "BEFORE" — neglected winter pool, debris, green water
**Slide 2:** "AFTER" — same pool, crystal clear, swim-ready

**Caption:**
6 hours. That's how long it took our team to transform this neglected pool into summer-ready condition.

The homeowner thought they'd need to drain and refill (=$$$). We diagnosed the issue: dead pump + chemical imbalance. Fixed both, saved the water, saved the money.

Don't assume the worst. Call the pros first.

✅ Small suburban lots
✅ Year-round use (heated = hot tub mode in winter)

Installation takes 5-7 days. Cost is 1/3 of a traditional pool. Maintenance? Minimal.

We've installed 100+ plunge pools across the Main Line, Hockessin, and beyond.

Swipe up (or click link in bio) to see if a plunge pool fits your space.

### Post 5: "Water Chemistry Made Simple" 🧪
**Format:** Infographic carousel (4 slides)
**Caption Length:** Long (educational)

**Slide 1:** Title card "POOL CHEMISTRY 101"
**Slide 2:** pH scale graphic (7.2-7.6 optimal)
**Slide 3:** Chlorine levels graphic (1-3 ppm)
**Slide 4:** "When to call a pro" CTA

**Caption:**
Pool chemistry isn't rocket science — but it IS chemistry. Get it wrong and you're swimming in bacteria or bleaching your swimsuit.

Here's the 30-second version of what every pool owner should know 👆

**The 3 numbers that matter:**
🔬 pH: 7.2 - 7.6 (balances comfort + sanitizer effectiveness)
🧪 Chlorine: 1-3 ppm (kills bacteria, keeps water clear)
📊 Alkalinity: 80-120 ppm (stabilizes pH so it doesn't bounce)

**When to test:** Weekly minimum. Daily during heavy use or heat waves.

**When to call us:**
→ Numbers won't stay balanced no matter what you add
→ Water stays cloudy after shocking
→ You're adding chemicals every other day
→ You just want someone else to handle it 😎

TriState Aquatic Solutions offers weekly maintenance plans — we handle the chemistry, you handle the cannonballs.

📞 (302) 870-3113 for maintenance plan pricing
