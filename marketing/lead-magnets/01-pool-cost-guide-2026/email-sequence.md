Hi {{First Name}},

Did you get a chance to look at the Cost Guide? If you have not yet, no worries - it is not going anywhere.

But I wanted to expand on something important: **hidden costs**.

In Chapter 5 of the guide, we cover the expenses that surprise homeowners. Here are the five that catch people most off guard:

**1. Rock Excavation**
In Chester County and parts of the Main Line, hitting rock is common. This can add $3,000 to $15,000 to your project if not budgeted.

**2. Electrical Panel Upgrades**
Many homes (especially those built before 2000) need a panel upgrade to handle pool equipment. Budget $1,500 to $3,500.

**3. Fence Requirements**
PA and DE law requires pool fencing. If you do not have an existing fence, expect $3,000 to $8,000.

**4. Extended Decking**
The "basic patio" included with most pools is minimal (3-4 feet around). Most homeowners want more space, adding $5,000 to $20,000+.

**5. Landscaping Restoration**
Heavy equipment tears up your yard. Restoration and new landscaping typically runs $2,000 to $10,000.

**The Solution?**

Always ask for a detailed, line-item quote - not a lump sum price. And add 10-15% contingency to your budget for the unexpected.

Tomorrow, I will share the questions that help you vet pool contractors like a pro.

Hi {{First Name}},

Choosing the right pool contractor might be the most important decision in this entire process.

The wrong choice leads to delays, surprise costs, and frustration. The right choice means a smooth installation and a pool you will love for decades.

Here are **10 questions to ask every contractor** before you sign:

1. How long have you been installing pools specifically in this area?
2. Can you provide 3-5 references from the past 12 months?
3. What does your warranty cover, and for how long?
4. Who handles permits and inspections?
5. What happens if you hit rock or groundwater?
6. Is your price guaranteed, or can it change after signing?
7. What is your payment schedule? (Be wary of large upfront payments over 33%)
8. Who will be on-site daily supervising the work?
9. How do you handle change orders?
10. What is your process for addressing concerns after installation?

**Red Flags to Watch:**
- Vague pricing without line-item breakdown
- No written contract
- Pressure to sign immediately
- Demands for more than 33% upfront
- No portfolio or references

**Green Flags:**
- Transparent pricing
- Strong local references
- Clear communication process
- Reasonable payment schedule
- Manufacturer partnerships and certifications

I share this because I genuinely want you to have a great experience - whether you work with us or someone else.

### Email 4: Day 7 - Home Value Impact

**Subject:** How pools affect home value on the Main Line

Hi {{First Name}},

One question I get constantly: "Will a pool increase my home value?"

The honest answer: It depends on your market.

Here is what the data shows for our area:

**In premium neighborhoods** (homes valued $500K+), pools typically add 5-8% to home value. On a $750,000 Main Line home, that could mean $37,500 to $60,000 in added value.

**Key factors that maximize ROI:**
- Quality hardscaping (not just a small concrete apron)
- Modern, clean aesthetic
- Low-maintenance materials
- Salt water systems
- Energy-efficient equipment

**What does not help:**
- Dated designs
- Deferred maintenance
- Cheap materials
- Poor integration with landscaping

But here is what I tell homeowners:

**Calculate the lifestyle value, not just the financial return.**

Consider what you would spend on:
- Pool club memberships ($1,500-$5,000/year)
- Vacation travel for water recreation
- Entertainment venues

Then factor in:
- Quality time with family at home
- Convenience
- Health benefits
- Stress reduction

For most families, the lifestyle value far exceeds the resale calculation.

Best,

### Email 5: Day 14 - Timeline Planning

**Subject:** When to start your pool project (and why waiting costs more)

Hi {{First Name}},

Quick timing insight that could save you money and stress:

**The best time to start planning a pool is 6-9 months before you want to swim.**

Here is why:

**Off-Season Planning (October - February):**
- Contractors have more availability
- You get more attention on your project
- Potential pricing flexibility
- Time to make thoughtful decisions
- Spring/early summer completion

**Peak Season Rush (March - June):**
- Highest demand
- Longer wait times
- Less scheduling flexibility
- Summer installation means less swim time

**Realistic Timelines:**

*Fiberglass:* 6-12 weeks total (fastest option)
*Vinyl:* 7-14 weeks total
*Concrete:* 14-28 weeks total

If swimming by Memorial Day is your goal, starting the process in winter is ideal.

Where are you in your planning? Reply and let me know - I am happy to suggest next steps based on your timeline.

Best,
**Brandon**
