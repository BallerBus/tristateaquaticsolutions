Hi {{First Name}},

Let us talk about Phase 2 of your checklist: Design Decisions.

This is where many homeowners get stuck. With so many options, how do you choose?

Here is my simplified framework:

**Choosing Pool Type:**

*Choose Fiberglass if:*
- You value lower maintenance
- Standard shapes work for your yard
- You want faster installation (weeks, not months)
- Long-term value matters more than upfront cost

*Choose Concrete if:*
- Custom shape is essential
- You need a very large or unique design
- Budget is flexible
- You are okay with longer construction and more maintenance

*Choose Vinyl if:*
- Upfront cost is the primary factor
- You accept liner replacement every 7-12 years
- Basic shapes meet your needs

**Choosing Features:**

Here is my rule of thumb:

*Prioritize features you will use daily:*
- Tanning ledge (if you enjoy lounging in the water)
- Salt system (if you dislike chlorine smell)
- Heater (if you want extended season swimming)
- Automation (if convenience matters)

*Consider carefully before adding:*
- Water features (beautiful but add maintenance)
- Spa (significant cost, requires separate heating)
- Diving area (requires deeper water, more space)

Go through the Feature Selection section in Phase 2 and rate each feature honestly. "Nice to have" is different from "will actually use."

What feature is at the top of your list? Reply and let me know.

Hi {{First Name}},

Phase 3 of your checklist covers contractor vetting. This might be the most important phase.

Here is the reality: The contractor you choose impacts everything - your timeline, your budget, your experience, and your final result.

**Beyond the standard questions, here are five that separate serious contractors:**

**1. "What happens if you hit rock or groundwater?"**

Good answer: Clear explanation of process and cost structure
Red flag: "That won't happen" or vague deflection

**2. "Can I speak with a customer whose pool you completed in the last 60 days?"**

Good answer: "Absolutely, here are a few options"
Red flag: Only provides older references (projects from years ago)

**3. "Who is on-site every day, and how do I reach them?"**

Good answer: Named project manager with direct contact
Red flag: "Just call the office"

**4. "Walk me through your payment schedule."**

Good answer: Milestone-based payments tied to completed work
Red flag: Large upfront payment (over 33%) or vague timing

**5. "What is NOT included in this quote?"**

Good answer: Clear explanation of allowances and potential additions
Red flag: "Everything is included" with no specifics

**The Reference Call Script:**

When you call references, ask:
- Was the project completed on schedule?
- Was the final cost close to the estimate?
- How would you rate their communication?
- What surprised you (good or bad)?
- Would you hire them again?

Use the Contractor Comparison Worksheet in Phase 3 to track your research.

## Follow-Up Nurture Sequence

### Email 4: Day 7 - Permit Process

**Subject:** Permits in {{Township}} - what to expect

Hi {{First Name}},

Phase 5 of your checklist covers permits, but let me give you some additional context.

In the Main Line area, permit timelines vary significantly by township:

**Lower Merion:** 6-10 weeks (longest in the area)
**Radnor:** 6-8 weeks
**Tredyffrin:** 4-8 weeks
**Haverford:** 4-6 weeks

**What most people do not realize:**

1. **Your contractor typically handles permits** - but you should understand the process
2. **Permit approval often happens BEFORE signing** if your contractor plans properly
3. **Delays usually come from incomplete applications** - not slow townships
4. **Engineering may be required** in certain situations (slopes, near easements)

**The documents you will need:**
- Property survey
- Site plan showing pool location
- Pool specifications
- Equipment details
- Fencing plan
- Contractor license and insurance

Start gathering what you have. The Phase 5 checklist itemizes everything.

**One Important Note:**

If you live in an HOA, get that approval BEFORE submitting to the township. HOA delays can add weeks to your timeline.

Let me know if you have questions about your specific township.

### Email 5: Day 14 - Budget Reality Check

**Subject:** The budget conversation nobody wants to have

Hi {{First Name}},

Let us talk about Phase 6: Budget.

I will be direct - most homeowners underestimate pool costs.

Not because they are careless, but because initial research often shows base prices without the complete picture.

**Here is a more realistic framework:**

*If your research shows base pool price of $60,000...*

Add:
- Decking upgrade (most want more than basic): +$8,000-15,000
- Equipment upgrades (salt, heat, automation): +$3,000-8,000
- Site work (varies by property): +$2,000-10,000
- Permits and electrical: +$2,000-5,000
- Landscaping restoration: +$3,000-10,000
- Contingency (10%): +$7,000-10,000

*Realistic total: $85,000-120,000*

**This is not meant to discourage you.** It is meant to help you plan accurately.

**The Budget Worksheet in Phase 6 helps you:**
- Track every cost category
- Identify where you can save
- Build in appropriate contingency
- Avoid unpleasant surprises

Here is my advice: Set your total budget FIRST, then work backward to see what fits. Better to start realistic than be disappointed later.

What is your target budget range? Reply and I can give you a reality check on what to expect.

### Email 6: Day 21 - Check-In

**Subject:** How is planning going?

Hi {{First Name}},

You downloaded the planning checklist a few weeks ago. I wanted to check in.

Where are you in the process?

**If you are still researching** - Take your time. The checklist is not going anywhere, and planning properly now saves stress later.

**If you are getting serious** - This is when most people start talking to contractors. The Phase 3 vetting process will save you from common mistakes.

**If you are ready to move forward** - We would be honored to be considered for your project. We offer free, no-pressure consultations.

**[SCHEDULE A FREE CONSULTATION]** (button)

Either way, I am here to help. Reply with any questions - about the checklist, about planning, or about working with us.

Best,
