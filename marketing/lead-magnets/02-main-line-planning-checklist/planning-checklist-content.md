## Introduction: Why Planning Matters

A swimming pool is one of the most significant investments you will make in your home. In the Main Line area - where properties, regulations, and expectations are unique - proper planning is essential for success.

This checklist guides you through every phase of the pool planning process. Use it as your roadmap from initial research to the day you dive in.

### How to Use This Guide

Each section contains:
- **Information** to help you understand the phase
- **Action Items** you need to complete
