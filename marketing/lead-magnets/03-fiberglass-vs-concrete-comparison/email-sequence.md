Hi {{First Name}},

After helping hundreds of homeowners with this decision, I have noticed something:

**Most people already know which pool type fits them. They just need permission to trust their instinct.**

Here is the question that brings clarity:

**"Do you want a pool that requires minimal attention, or are you excited about the process of caring for a premium feature?"**

Be honest with yourself.

**If minimal attention appeals to you:**

You will love fiberglass. You will test the water, add chemicals occasionally, and spend most of your time enjoying the pool - not maintaining it.

**If caring for a premium feature sounds rewarding:**

Concrete might be your match. You will brush, balance, maintain - and take pride in keeping a custom masterpiece in perfect condition.

There is no wrong answer. But there is a wrong answer FOR YOU.

Which resonates more?

If you want to talk through your specific situation, reply to this email. I am happy to help you think through it.

## Email 3: Day 4 - The Cost Reality

**Subject Line Options:**
- The 10-year cost difference might surprise you
- What nobody tells you about pool costs
- The number that changes minds

**Email Body:**

Hi {{First Name}},

Let me share the number that surprises most homeowners:

**$65,000 to $100,000**

That is the typical 10-year cost difference between fiberglass and concrete pools in our area.

Here is the breakdown:

**Fiberglass (Medium Pool, 10 Years):**
- Installation: $66,000 - $96,000
- Operating costs: $18,000 - $30,000
- **Total: $84,000 - $126,000**

**Concrete (Medium Pool, 10 Years):**
- Installation: $114,000 - $168,000
- Operating costs: $34,600 - $58,400
- **Total: $149,000 - $226,000**

**Where the difference comes from:**

1. **Higher chemical costs** - Concrete is porous, requiring 30-50% more chemicals
2. **More maintenance** - Acid washing, replastering, repairs
3. **Higher energy** - Concrete loses heat faster, costs more to run
4. **Surface refinishing** - Plaster needs replacement every 8-12 years

**Does this mean concrete is a bad choice?**

Not at all. For homeowners who need unlimited customization and are willing to invest in maintenance, concrete pools are magnificent.

But if you are primarily drawn to concrete because you assume it is "better quality" - the data says otherwise.

What matters most to you: customization flexibility or long-term value?

P.S. Chapter 5 of the guide has the complete cost analysis with all the details.

### Email 4: Day 7 - Customization Reality Check

**Subject:** When concrete is the only choice (and when it is not)

Hi {{First Name}},

Let me be direct about when you actually need a concrete pool:

**Concrete is necessary if:**
- You need a width over 16 feet
- You want an infinity or vanishing edge
- You need a completely custom shape that does not exist in fiberglass
- You want a grotto, cave, or architectural feature
- Your pool must be unusually deep or have multiple depths

**Concrete is NOT necessary if:**
- You want a "custom look" (fiberglass offers many elegant options)
- You want a tanning ledge (most fiberglass pools have them)
- You want a spa (integrated spas available in fiberglass)
- You want quality (fiberglass is not budget - it is different)

Here is what I see often:

Homeowners assume concrete is the "premium" choice and fiberglass is the "budget" choice. That is outdated thinking.

Modern fiberglass pools are installed in luxury homes across the Main Line. Owners choose them specifically because they are high-quality AND low-maintenance.

The real question is: Do you need features that ONLY concrete provides?

If yes, concrete is your answer.
If no, fiberglass likely offers better value.

Reply if you want to discuss your specific design needs.

### Email 5: Day 14 - The Maintenance Reality

**Subject:** 20 minutes vs 60 minutes (every week, forever)

Hi {{First Name}},

I want to share something that does not get enough attention:

**The weekly maintenance difference.**

**Fiberglass weekly routine:**
- Test water (5 min)
- Add chemicals (5 min)
- Empty skimmer (2 min)
- Occasional brushing (10 min)
- **Total: 20-30 minutes**

**Concrete weekly routine:**
- Test water (5 min)
- Add chemicals (10 min)
- Empty skimmer (2 min)
- Brush walls and floor (25 min) - REQUIRED
- Vacuum (15 min)
- **Total: 50-60 minutes**

**Why the difference?**

Concrete is porous. Algae can embed in the surface. Skipping brushing leads to algae problems, staining, and surface degradation.

Fiberglass is non-porous. Algae cannot embed. A quick brush handles any surface debris.

**Over a swim season (May-September = 22 weeks):**
- Fiberglass: 7-11 hours of maintenance
- Concrete: 18-22 hours of maintenance

**Over 10 years:**
- Fiberglass: 70-110 hours
- Concrete: 180-220 hours

That is an extra 100+ hours of your life spent maintaining your pool instead of enjoying it.

Worth considering as you make your decision.

### Email 6: Day 21 - Decision Time

**Subject:** Ready to decide?

Hi {{First Name}},

You have had the comparison guide for a few weeks now. Where are you landing?

**If you are leaning fiberglass:**

We would love to show you what is possible. Our fiberglass pools feature:
- Premium finishes and elegant designs
- Integrated tanning ledges and bench seating
- Spillover spa options
- Fast installation (weeks, not months)
- Industry-leading warranties

**[SCHEDULE A FREE CONSULTATION]** (button)

**If you are leaning concrete:**

That is a perfectly valid choice for the right situation. We are happy to recommend reputable concrete builders in our area - just reply and ask.

**If you are still undecided:**

Sometimes talking through your specific property and needs brings clarity. We offer no-pressure consultations where we can discuss both options honestly.
