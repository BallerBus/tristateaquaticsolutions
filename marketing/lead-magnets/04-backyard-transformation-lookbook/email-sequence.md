Hi {{First Name}},

Did you find some designs you love in the lookbook?

Before you get too attached, let us talk about something important: **feature prioritization**.

It is easy to fall in love with a design that includes everything. Waterfall? Beautiful. Outdoor kitchen? Amazing. Infinity edge? Stunning.

But realistic planning requires prioritization.

**Here is my framework:**

**Tier 1: Essential Features**
Things you will use constantly and would regret not having.

Examples:
- Tanning ledge (if you love lounging in the water)
- Heater (if you want extended season swimming)
- Salt system (if you dislike chlorine smell)

**Tier 2: Important Features**
Things you will use regularly and would definitely enjoy.

Examples:
- Spa (if relaxation is a priority)
- Water feature (if ambiance matters)
- Color-changing lights (if you swim at night)

**Tier 3: Nice-to-Have Features**
Things that enhance experience but are not essential.

Examples:
- Automation (convenient but not critical)
- Specialty lighting (beautiful but optional)
- Sport features (depends on family)

**Tier 4: Future Additions**
Things you can add later without major reconstruction.

Examples:
- Landscaping upgrades
- Additional decking
- Fire features
- Furniture and accessories

Go back through your favorite designs. Which features fall into which tier for YOUR lifestyle?

This framework helps you stay on budget while getting what actually matters.

Reply and tell me: What is your top Tier 1 feature?

Hi {{First Name}},

Here is something that separates good pool installations from great ones:

**Architectural harmony.**

Your pool should feel like it belongs with your home - not like it was dropped into your backyard by accident.

**You mentioned your home style is {{Home Style}}. Here is what I recommend:**

**For Colonial/Traditional Homes:**

Look for:
- Rectangular or Roman shapes
- Natural stone (bluestone, flagstone, travertine)
- Symmetrical layouts
- Traditional fencing and landscaping
- Classic colors and materials

Best lookbook sections: Classic Elegance, Family Recreation, Attached Spa

**For Contemporary/Modern Homes:**

Look for:
- Geometric shapes with clean lines
- Large-format pavers or concrete
- Minimalist landscaping
- Integrated technology
- Monochromatic palettes

Best lookbook sections: Modern Minimalist, Contemporary Coastal, Lap Pool

**For Farmhouse/Rustic Homes:**

Look for:
- Organic shapes that follow natural contours
- Natural stone and wood elements
- Native plantings
- Casual, informal layouts
- Warm, earthy colors

Best lookbook sections: Natural Swimming Hole, Tuscan Villa, Four-Season Design

**The Goal:**

When someone sees your completed backyard, they should think: "Of course that pool belongs there."

Not: "That pool is nice, but it does not quite fit."

Does the design you are most drawn to match your home? Reply and let me know what you are thinking.

## Follow-Up Nurture Sequence

### Email 4: Day 7 - The Landscaping Factor

**Subject:** The design element most people underestimate

Hi {{First Name}},

Quick insight about pool design:

**Landscaping can make or break the final result.**

Two identical pools with different landscaping will look completely different. One might feel like a resort. The other might feel like a pool in a yard.

**The difference comes from:**

*Softscape (plants and greenery):*
- Foundation plantings around pool
- Privacy screening
- Specimen trees for shade and interest
- Seasonal color

*Hardscape (non-living elements):*
- Deck material and extent
- Walkways and paths
- Retaining walls
- Fire features and furniture areas

*Landscape lighting:*
- Uplighting on trees
- Path lighting
- Accent lighting on features
- Pool and patio illumination

**My Recommendation:**

When reviewing lookbook designs, pay attention to the landscaping as much as the pool. Then ask: What would it take to create similar landscaping on my property?

Sometimes the "look" you love is 50% pool and 50% landscaping. Budget accordingly.

What catches your eye in the landscaping of your favorite designs? Reply and let me know.
