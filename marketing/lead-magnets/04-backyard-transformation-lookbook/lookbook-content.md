### Design Elements to Consider

- View analysis (what will the edge frame?)
- Catch basin sizing and design
- Pump requirements (continuous edge flow)
- Lighting for evening drama
- Maintenance access

### Main Line Application
Infinity edges require specific site conditions - a meaningful elevation drop and desirable view. Properties with valley views, golf course adjacency, or natural vistas are ideal candidates. This feature requires concrete construction.

**Landscaping:** Different character for each zone

**Why It Works:**
The L-shape naturally separates active and passive zones. Adults can lounge while children play, each in their own space.

### Design Elements to Consider
- Depth zoning (shallow in one section, deep in another)
- Feature placement (spa in corner, tanning ledge in L)
- Deck configuration around the shape
- Landscape rooms created by pool geometry
- Traffic flow between zones
- Sight lines and supervision

### Main Line Application
L-shapes and freeform pools fit irregular lots, work around mature trees, and create architectural interest. They are available in fiberglass (limited shapes) and concrete (any shape).
