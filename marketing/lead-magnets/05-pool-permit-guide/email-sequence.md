**Email Body:**

Hi {{First Name}},

After pulling hundreds of pool permits across PA and DE, I can tell you the issues that cause delays:

**1. Incomplete Applications**

The most common problem - and the most avoidable.

*Solution:* Use the checklist in Chapter 5. Verify every document is included before submission.

**2. Setback Violations**

Pool placed too close to property lines.

*Solution:* Know your setbacks BEFORE finalizing design. In {{Township}}, check the specific requirements in the guide.

**3. Missing or Outdated Survey**

Many townships require a property survey.

*Solution:* Locate your existing survey or budget $400-800 for a new one if needed.

**4. Fence Non-Compliance**

Barrier does not meet code requirements.

*Solution:*
- Minimum 48 inches tall
- Self-closing, self-latching gates
- No gaps larger than 4 inches
- Include detailed fence plan with application

**5. Electrical Issues**

Electrical plan does not meet current code.

*Solution:* Use licensed electrician familiar with pool requirements. GFCI protection and bonding are critical.

**The Good News:**

All of these are avoidable with proper preparation. The guide has everything you need to submit a complete, compliant application.

Reply if you have questions about any of these issues.

## Email 3: Day 4 - Timeline Reality

**Subject Line Options:**

**Email Body:**

Hi {{First Name}},

Let me be direct about permit timelines:

**The typical range is 4-8 weeks.** But that depends on many factors.

**What speeds up approval:**
- Complete application (no missing documents)
- Clear, accurate site plan
- Standard project (no variances needed)
- Off-season submission (fall/winter)
- Responsive to any questions

**What slows down approval:**
- Missing documentation
- Setback issues requiring variance
- Historical district or special overlay review
- Peak season submission (spring/summer)
- Complex projects

**For {{Township}} specifically:**

Check the guide for typical timeline. Some townships (like Lower Merion) run longer due to stricter review processes. Others move faster.

**My Recommendation:**

Apply for permits as early as possible - ideally before you are ready to start construction. This buffer prevents timeline stress.

If you are working with a contractor, ask them specifically about their permit timeline experience in your township.

**Brandon**

P.S. Speaking of contractors - my next email covers how a good contractor handles permits for you.

## Follow-Up Nurture Sequence

### Email 4: Day 7 - How Contractors Handle Permits

**Subject:** What your contractor should do for you

Hi {{First Name}},

You mentioned you are {{Contractor Status}} with a contractor.

Let me explain how the permit process typically works:

**What a good contractor handles:**

1. **Documentation Preparation**
   - Prepares all required plans
   - Creates site plans and specifications
   - Coordinates engineering if needed

2. **Application Submission**
   - Completes permit applications
   - Submits to building department
   - Pays permit fees (typically included in project cost)

3. **Follow-Up**
   - Tracks application status
   - Responds to building department questions
   - Addresses any required revisions

4. **Inspection Coordination**
   - Schedules all required inspections
   - Ensures work is ready for inspection
   - Addresses any inspection issues

**What you provide:**

- Property survey (if available)
- HOA approval (if applicable)
- Signed authorizations
- Access to property

**Red Flags:**

- Contractor asking YOU to pull permits
- Vague answers about permit timeline
- Suggesting to start without permits
- No experience with your specific township

**{{If working with contractor}}:**
Ask them specifically: "What is your typical permit timeline in my township, and what do you need from me?"

**{{If not yet working with contractor}}:**
When you start interviewing contractors, permit handling should be part of the conversation.

Questions? Reply anytime.

### Email 5: Day 14 - The Inspection Process

**Subject:** What to expect during inspections

Hi {{First Name}},

The permit is just the beginning. Here is what happens after:

**Typical Inspection Sequence:**

1. **Stakeout/Pre-Construction**
   - Verifies pool location matches approved plans
   - Confirms setback compliance

2. **Excavation**
   - Reviews hole dimensions
   - Checks for issues (groundwater, rock)

3. **Shell/Structure**
   - Fiberglass: verifies placement and level
   - Concrete: inspects steel and forms

4. **Plumbing**
   - Checks pipe routing and connections

5. **Electrical**
   - GFCI verification
   - Bonding inspection
   - Equipment connections

6. **Backfill** (fiberglass)
   - Monitors backfill process and compaction

7. **Final**
   - Complete installation review
   - Pool operational
   - All safety features in place

**Your Role:**

Mostly: stay informed. Your contractor handles scheduling and attending inspections.

Being home during inspections is nice but usually not required. Your contractor should update you after each inspection.

**What Can Go Wrong:**

Rarely anything major if contractor is experienced. Minor corrections are common and quickly addressed.

The guide has a complete inspection checklist if you want to follow along with your project.
