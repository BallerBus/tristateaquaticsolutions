## Template 2: Guest Posting Pitch to Home Improvement Blogs

**Subject:** Guest post idea: "The Hidden Costs of Pool Ownership Nobody Talks About"

**To:** Home improvement blogs, lifestyle publications, home and garden websites

---

Hi [Editor Name],

I'm Brandon Calloway, a pool installation expert with 15+ years in the industry, now running Tri-State Aquatic Solutions in the Philadelphia area.

I'd love to contribute a guest post to [Publication Name] that would genuinely help your readers. Here are three topic ideas:

**1. "The Hidden Costs of Pool Ownership Nobody Talks About"**
A transparent look at what homeowners should budget beyond the installation price - from insurance increases to maintenance schedules. Practical advice, not sales pitch.

**2. "Fiberglass vs. Concrete Pools: A Contractor's Honest Assessment"**
An unbiased comparison from someone who's installed hundreds of both. When each makes sense, and when they don't.

**3. "What to Ask Your Pool Contractor Before Signing (From a Pool Contractor)"**
The questions I wish every homeowner would ask - and the answers that reveal whether you're working with a professional or a problem.

**Why me?**
- Owner-operator who's personally installed 200+ pools
- Deep knowledge of Main Line PA/Delaware market and regulations
- Can provide original photos from real projects
- Available for follow-up questions from your readers

I write in a conversational, educational style and am happy to follow your editorial guidelines. Here's a sample of my work: [link to existing blog post].

Would any of these topics work for your readers?

Best,

## Template 3: Real Estate Agent Partnership Proposal

**Subject:** Passive income opportunity: Pool referral partnership

**To:** Real estate agents in Main Line PA, Chester County, Northern Delaware

---

Hi [Agent Name],

I help homeowners across the Main Line and Chester County turn their backyards into private retreats. And I've noticed something: real estate agents are constantly asked about pool installation - but rarely get paid for their recommendations.

I'd like to change that for you.

**The Partnership:**
- You refer clients to Tri-State Aquatic Solutions
- We pay you a 3% referral fee on completed installations
- Average pool = $55,000 = $1,650 for you

**Why Your Clients Will Thank You:**
- 2-4 week installation (fiberglass), not 6 months
- Transparent, itemized pricing - no surprises
- Owner-supervised installation on every project
- Local company with deep Main Line expertise

**Why You'll Love This:**
- Passive income with zero effort
- Make your clients happy
- Look like a connected, knowledgeable agent
- Competitive advantage over other agents

**The Math:**
20 home sales/year x 5 clients wanting pools x $55,000 average = $8,250/year in referral fees for you.

I'm partnering with just 5-10 agents in your area this season. Would you be interested in being one of them?

I'd love to meet for coffee and discuss how this could work for your business.

Best,

Brandon Calloway

## Template 4: Landscaper/Contractor Partnership Email

**Subject:** Win-win partnership idea for [Their Company Name]

**To:** Landscapers, hardscape contractors, deck builders, outdoor kitchen installers

---

Hi [Name],

I'm Brandon Calloway with Tri-State Aquatic Solutions. We install fiberglass and plunge pools across the Main Line and Northern Delaware.

I've noticed that many of your landscaping projects would pair beautifully with a pool - and many of my pool projects need expert landscaping. I think we could help each other.

**Here's what I'm proposing:**

**Mutual Referral Program:**
- You refer pool-interested clients to us: We pay 5% of the installation cost
- We refer landscaping/hardscaping clients to you: You keep 100% of that revenue

**Joint Project Collaboration:**
- Pool + landscape packages we can pitch together
- Streamlined scheduling so our crews work in sequence, not conflict
- Shared before/after portfolio for marketing

**Co-Marketing Opportunities:**
- Feature each other on our websites (with backlinks)
- Joint social media content showcasing complete backyard transformations
- Shared booth at home shows (split costs, double the leads)

Our clients are investing $50,000-$100,000+ in their backyards. They want the full experience - not just a pool sitting in a grass lawn.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore how we could work together?

**To:** Local journalists, magazine editors, lifestyle writers

---

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out with a story idea that's highly relevant to your Main Line readers.

**The Trend:**
Since 2020, backyard investment has exploded in the suburbs. But what's happening now is different: homeowners are treating their backyards as true outdoor living spaces - not just lawns with a pool.

**The Story:**
I'm a local pool installer (Tri-State Aquatic Solutions) who's seen this evolution firsthand. I can share:

- **Access:** Photos and walkthroughs of stunning local transformations (with homeowner permission)
- **Trend Insights:** Why plunge pools and compact designs are overtaking traditional large pools
- **Local Angle:** How Chester County soil conditions and township regulations shape what's possible

**Why This Story Works:**
- Evergreen relevance (can run any time before summer)
- Strong visual potential (before/after photography)
- Local business + homeowner human interest angle
- Practical value for readers considering similar projects

**What I Can Provide:**
- On-the-record interviews
- Access to current project sites for photography
- Connections to homeowner clients willing to share their stories
- Industry expertise on trends and costs

Would this be something your readers would find interesting? Happy to jump on a quick call to discuss.

## Template 7: Interior Designer Collaboration

**Subject:** Outdoor living collaboration for your Main Line clients

**To:** Interior designers, architectural designers, home staging professionals

Hi [Name],

I've admired your work on [Project/Portfolio Reference] - your attention to detail is exceptional.

I'm Brandon Calloway with Tri-State Aquatic Solutions. We design and install premium fiberglass pools for Main Line and Delaware homeowners.

**I've noticed a gap in the market:** Interior designers create stunning home interiors, but outdoor spaces often get overlooked. I think we could change that together.

**Collaboration Ideas:**

**1. Seamless Indoor-Outdoor Design**
- I can coordinate pool design to complement your interior vision
- Matching color palettes, materials, and style continuity

**2. Client Referrals**
- When my clients need interior design for their pool house, cabana, or main home - I send them to you
- When your clients dream of an outdoor oasis - you send them to me

**3. Joint Portfolio**
- "Complete Home Transformation" case studies featuring both of our work
- Shared photography for mutual marketing

**4. Designer Input Program**
- Bring you in as a consultant on my projects (paid)
- Your design eye + my pool expertise = unbeatable results

Our typical client invests $60,000-$100,000+ in their outdoor space. They're the same clientele who invest in premium interior design.

Would you be interested in grabbing coffee to discuss how we might work together?
