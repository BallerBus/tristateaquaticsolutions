### Testing Budget Allocation

**Initial Testing Phase (First 60 Days):**

Allocate 20-30% of budget specifically for testing before scaling.

| Test Category | Monthly Budget | Purpose |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Creative Testing | $500-$800 | Test 4-6 creative variations |
| Audience Testing | $400-$600 | Test 3-5 audience segments |

| Copy Testing | $200-$300 | Test headlines and primary text |
| **Total Testing** | **$1,300-$2,000** | ~30% of monthly budget |

**Testing Protocol:**
- Run tests for minimum 7 days or 1,000 impressions per variant
- Use statistical significance calculator before declaring winners
- Document learnings in testing log
- Apply learnings to scale winning combinations

---

### Scaling Guidelines

**When to Scale Up:**

| Metric | Threshold for Scaling |
|--------|----------------------|
| Cost Per Lead | Below $50 consistently |
| Lead Quality Score | 7+ (based on conversion rate) |
| ROAS | Above 3:1 |
| Frequency | Below 3 (room to increase reach) |
| Relevance Score | Above 7/10 |

**How to Scale:**

1. **Horizontal Scaling (Safer):**
   - Duplicate winning ad sets
   - Test new audience segments
   - Add new creative variations
   - Expand to similar lookalike sizes

2. **Vertical Scaling (Riskier):**
   - Increase budget by 20-30% every 3-4 days
   - Never increase more than 50% at once
   - Monitor performance closely for 48-72 hours after increases

**When to Scale Down:**

| Metric | Threshold for Scaling Down |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Cost Per Lead | Above $75 for 5+ days |
| Frequency | Above 5 |
| CTR | Below 0.5% |
| Relevance Score | Below 5/10 |
| Lead Quality | Poor sales feedback |

---

### Budget Pacing Guidelines

**Daily Spend Monitoring:**
- Check spend at 12pm and 6pm
- If underspending by 20%+, check ad delivery issues
- If overspending, verify no budget errors

**Weekly Review:**
- Compare actual spend to planned spend
- Reallocate from underperforming campaigns
- Adjust bids based on cost trends

**Monthly Reconciliation:**
- Review total spend vs. budget
- Calculate true cost per lead
- Track lead-to-sale conversion
- Adjust next month's budget accordingly

### Expected Performance Benchmarks

| Metric | Awareness | Consideration | Conversion | Retargeting |
|--------|-----------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| CPM | $10-18 | $15-25 | $20-35 | $8-15 |
| CTR | 0.5-1.5% | 1-2.5% | 1.5-4% | 2-6% |
| CPC | $0.80-2.00 | $1.00-2.50 | $1.50-3.00 | $0.50-1.50 |
| CPL | N/A | $60-100 | $35-60 | $20-40 |
| Conversion Rate | N/A | 1-3% | 3-8% | 5-12% |

---

### Budget Calculator

**Formula for Required Budget:**

```
Required Monthly Budget = (Target Leads x Average CPL) / Expected Conversion Rate

Example:
- Target Leads: 50/month
- Average CPL: $45
- Expected Conversion Rate: 5%

Budget = 50 x $45 / 0.05 = $45,000 / 0.05 = $4,500/month
```

**ROI Calculation:**

```
Expected Revenue = Leads x Consultation Rate x Close Rate x Average Project Value

Example:
- Monthly Leads: 50
- Consultation Rate: 60%
- Close Rate: 25%
- Average Project Value: $65,000

Revenue = 50 x 0.60 x 0.25 x $65,000 = $487,500
Ad Spend: $4,500
ROAS: $487,500 / $4,500 = 108:1 (theoretical max)
```
