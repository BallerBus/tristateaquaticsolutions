3.  Click the blue **Add** button.
4.  Name your Pixel (e.g., "TriState Aquatic Solutions Pixel") and click **Continue**.
5.  You will be asked how you want to install the Pixel. Choose **Manually add pixel code to website**.
6.  A new screen will show you the Pixel base code. Click the code to copy it to your clipboard.
7.  **IMPORTANT:** Paste this code into a text file and save it. We will need to provide this code to the development team (Claude Code) to install on the website.
8.  Once you've copied the code, you can close the window.

**Result:** A Meta Pixel has been created. Send the copied code to Claude Code for installation.

## Next Steps

Once you have completed these steps, please notify me (Marlo) and Claude Code.

-   **For Marlo:** Confirm that the Facebook Page, Instagram Account, and Ad Account are set up. I can then begin drafting ad campaigns.
-   **For Claude Code:** Provide the copied Meta Pixel code for installation on the website.

This setup is the foundation for all our social media advertising efforts. Completing it unblocks a major revenue channel for the spring season.
