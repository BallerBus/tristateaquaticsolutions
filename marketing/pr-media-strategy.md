TRI-STATE AQUATIC SOLUTIONS EXPANDS PREMIUM POOL INSTALLATION SERVICES TO MAIN LINE PHILADELPHIA

Hockessin-Based Company Brings Modern Fiberglass Pool Technology to Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery Counties

HOCKESSIN, DE (February 2026) - Tri-State Aquatic Solutions, a trusted name in pool maintenance across Northern Delaware, today announced the expansion of its premium pool installation services to the Main Line Philadelphia area, including Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery Counties.

The expansion brings fiberglass pool technology - known for faster installation times and lower lifetime maintenance costs - to affluent communities throughout the region.

"Main Line homeowners deserve pool installation options that respect their time and deliver premium results," said Brandon Calloway, Owner of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions. "Modern fiberglass technology allows us to transform backyards in weeks, not months, without sacrificing quality or customization."

Key features of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions' service include:

- 2-4 week installation timeline (vs. 4-6 months for traditional concrete)
- Owner involvement on every project
- Transparent, fixed pricing with no hidden costs
- Lifetime warranty on pool shell structural integrity
- Ongoing maintenance services for long-term partnership

The company currently serves homeowners across Hockessin, Wilmington, the Main Line, and surrounding areas. All installations use premium equipment from industry-leading brands including Pentair, Hayward, and Jandy.

LOCAL POOL EXPERT REVEALS TOP 5 BACKYARD POOL TRENDS FOR 2026

From Plunge Pools to Smart Technology, Main Line Homeowners Are Rethinking the Traditional Pool

HOCKESSIN, DE (February 2026) - As spring approaches and homeowners begin planning outdoor projects, local pool installation expert Brandon Calloway of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions shares the top pool trends shaping backyard design in 2026.

**1. Plunge Pools Dominate Small Spaces**
"Not every yard needs an Olympic-sized pool," says Calloway. "Plunge pools - compact pools typically under 400 square feet - are exploding in popularity among Main Line homeowners with smaller lots or those seeking a more intimate backyard experience."

**2. Fiberglass Over Concrete**
Installation times for fiberglass pools average 2-4 weeks versus 4-6 months for concrete. "Busy professionals don't want their backyard torn up for half a year. Fiberglass delivers the same luxury aesthetic with a fraction of the disruption."

**3. Year-Round Wellness Features**
Cold plunge pools and heated spa combinations allow homeowners to use their pools throughout all four seasons, supporting the growing wellness trend.

**4. Smart Pool Technology**
Automated systems from brands like Pentair and Hayward allow pool owners to control temperature, lighting, and chemistry from their smartphones.

**5. Sustainable Design**
Energy-efficient pumps, LED lighting, and solar heating options reflect homeowners' growing interest in environmentally responsible choices.

"Pool design has evolved dramatically in the past five years," notes Calloway. "Today's homeowners want speed, efficiency, and sustainability without compromising on luxury."

Brandon Calloway is available for interviews and expert commentary on pool trends, installation processes, and backyard design.

# 2. Media Pitch Templates

## Pitch 1: The Rise of Plunge Pools in Small Backyards

**Subject Line Options:**
- Story Idea: Why Main Line Homeowners Are Going Smaller with Their Pools
- The Plunge Pool Revolution Hitting Philadelphia Suburbs
- Think Your Yard Is Too Small? The Pool Trend Proving Otherwise

**Email Template:**

```
Dear [Reporter Name],

I noticed your recent coverage of [relevant topic/home design/local trends] and thought you might be interested in a story about a surprising trend reshaping backyards across the Main Line: plunge pools.

THE TREND:
Small-footprint "plunge pools" (typically under 400 square feet) are surging in popularity among affluent homeowners who previously thought their yards were too small for a pool. These compact pools deliver full luxury features - heated water, LED lighting, custom finishes - in a fraction of the space.

THE LOCAL ANGLE:
- Main Line homes on 1/4 to 1/2 acre lots are ideal candidates
- Cold plunge wellness trend is driving adoption among health-conscious buyers
- Installation takes just 2-3 weeks with minimal yard disruption

THE EXPERT:
Brandon Calloway, owner of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions in Hockessin, has seen plunge pool inquiries triple over the past year. He can provide:
- Before/after photos of local plunge pool installations
- Cost comparisons (plunge pools start around $35,000 vs. $60,000+ for traditional pools)
- Design options for different yard sizes and styles
- Interview availability for photos/video at active job sites

Would you be interested in exploring this trend for your readers? I'm happy to arrange a conversation with Brandon or coordinate a site visit to a current project.

Best regards,
[Your name]
Tri-State Aquatic Solutions

## Pitch 2: Why Main Line Homeowners Are Choosing Fiberglass

**Subject Line Options:**
- The Pool Material 90% of Homeowners Don't Know About
- Why Smart Main Line Buyers Are Skipping Concrete Pools
- 2 Weeks vs. 6 Months: The Pool Technology Changing Everything

**Email Template:**

```
Dear [Reporter Name],

I'm reaching out with a story idea that might surprise your readers: the pools being installed across the Main Line in 2026 look nothing like the pools their parents built.

THE SHIFT:
Fiberglass pools have quietly captured over 60% of the residential pool market, yet most homeowners still assume concrete is their only option. The technology has evolved dramatically, offering:
- Installation in 2-4 weeks (vs. 4-6 months for concrete)
- 50% lower lifetime maintenance costs
- Smoother, non-porous surfaces that resist algae
- Built-in luxury features (tanning ledges, spa spillovers, custom lighting)

WHY THIS MATTERS LOCALLY:
Main Line homeowners are busy professionals who can't afford to have their backyards under construction for half a year. Fiberglass technology respects their time without sacrificing quality.

THE EXPERT SOURCE:
Brandon Calloway of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions can walk you through a side-by-side comparison and explain:
- Why contractors don't always mention fiberglass (hint: concrete is more profitable for them)
- How fiberglass pools handle our PA/DE climate and soil conditions
- Real cost comparisons from recent local installations
- The innovations making fiberglass look as custom as concrete

This would make an excellent piece for homeowners planning spring renovations. Can I arrange a conversation with Brandon?

Best regards,
[Your name]
```

## Pitch 3: Pool Installation in 2 Weeks vs. 6 Months

**Subject Line Options:**
- From Hole in the Ground to Swimming: How 2-Week Pools Work
- The Construction Timeline That's Shocking Pool Buyers
- Your Backyard, Transformed in Two Weeks

**Email Template:**

```
Dear [Reporter Name],

What if I told you a complete, luxury pool installation could happen in the time most contractors take to "get started" on a concrete pool?

THE STORY:
Modern pool installation has been revolutionized by fiberglass and pre-manufactured pool technology, but many homeowners don't realize how dramatically timelines have changed. A typical installation now looks like:

WEEK 1: Excavation, shell delivery, positioning
WEEK 2: Plumbing, electrical, equipment installation
WEEK 3-4: Decking, landscaping, startup

That's it. Compare that to the 4-6 month ordeal of a gunite/concrete pool.

VISUAL OPPORTUNITY:
I can coordinate access to an active installation site where your photographer could capture:
- The dramatic moment of a one-piece fiberglass shell being craned into place
- Before/during/after shots of a complete transformation
- The homeowners' reaction to their finished pool

THE EXPERT:
Brandon Calloway, owner of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions, can walk through the entire process and explain why speed doesn't mean cutting corners. He's available for on-site interviews during active installations.

This would make compelling visual content for your spring home improvement coverage. Interested in a site visit?

Best regards,
[Your name]

## Pitch 4: How Pools Affect Home Values in PA

**Subject Line Options:**
- Does a Pool Add Value in Pennsylvania? The Answer May Surprise You
- The ROI Question Every Pool Buyer Should Ask
- Real Estate + Pool: What Main Line Buyers Need to Know

**Email Template:**

```
Dear [Reporter Name],

With spring real estate season approaching, I wanted to share a story angle that affects thousands of your readers: the real impact of pools on home values in our region.

THE STORY:
The conventional wisdom that "pools don't add value" may not apply to affluent markets like the Main Line. Local experts are seeing:
- Premium homes with pools selling faster in many neighborhoods
- Buyer expectations shifting (pools becoming "expected" at certain price points)
- ROI ranging from 50-80% of installation cost, with higher returns in luxury markets

THE NUANCE:
The value equation depends heavily on:
- Neighborhood norms and lot sizes
- Pool type and condition
- Quality of installation and landscaping integration

THE EXPERT ANGLE:
Brandon Calloway of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions works closely with realtors across the Main Line and can provide:
- Perspective on what's selling in different price brackets
- Tips for homeowners considering selling with or without a pool
- Design decisions that maximize resale value
- Common mistakes that hurt rather than help home values

I can also connect you with local realtors who specialize in properties with pools.

Would this make a good piece for your real estate or home sections?

Best regards,
[Your name]

## Pitch 5: The Technology Behind Modern Pool Design

**Subject Line Options:**
- Your Smartphone Can Now Control Your Pool
- The Tech That's Making Pool Ownership Effortless
- Smart Pools: When Silicon Valley Meets the Backyard

**Email Template:**

```
Dear [Reporter Name],

Given your coverage of smart home technology, I thought you'd be interested in one area that's often overlooked: pool automation and connectivity.

THE TECH STORY:
Modern pools bear little resemblance to the high-maintenance money pits of previous generations. Today's pool owners can:
- Control heating, lighting, and water features from their phones
- Receive automatic alerts when chemistry is off-balance
- Monitor energy usage in real-time
- Integrate pool functions with home automation systems (Alexa, Google Home)

THE EQUIPMENT:
Systems from Pentair, Hayward, and Jandy now offer app-controlled automation that handles:
- Variable-speed pumps that cut energy costs by 50-70%
- LED lighting with millions of color options
- Automated chemical dosing for perfect water balance
- Solar heating integration

THE LOCAL EXPERT:
Brandon Calloway of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions installs these systems daily and can demonstrate:
- Live pool control via smartphone
- Energy savings data from local installations
- How automation changes the ownership experience
- What's coming next in pool technology

This would fit well in your tech or lifestyle coverage. Can I arrange a demonstration?

Best regards,
[Your name]

## Pitch 6: Local Business Spotlight Angle

**Subject Line Options:**
- Local Entrepreneur Bets on Pool Industry Disruption
- From Pool Maintenance to Installation: A Small Business Growth Story
- Main Line's New Pool Company Focuses on What Big Chains Miss

**Email Template:**

```
Dear [Reporter Name],

I'm reaching out about a potential local business profile: a Hockessin entrepreneur who's challenging how the pool industry operates.

THE STORY:
Brandon Calloway started Tri-State Aquatic Solutions as a pool maintenance company serving 30+ families. He noticed something troubling: homeowners consistently shared horror stories about their pool installation experiences - hidden costs, absent contractors, and projects that dragged on for months.

So he expanded into installation with a fundamentally different approach:
- Transparent, fixed pricing (no change orders)
- Owner involvement on every job site (not a rotating crew of subcontractors)
- 2-4 week timelines using modern fiberglass technology
- Lifetime ongoing relationship (installation AND maintenance)

THE COMPETITIVE ANGLE:
The pool industry is dominated by large national chains with mixed reputations. Calloway's bet is that affluent homeowners will pay for personalized service and accountability.

THE PROFILE:
Brandon can discuss:
- Building a business in a market dominated by larger players
- Why he chose fiberglass over traditional concrete
- The challenges of scaling a service business
- His vision for the company's future

This would make a strong local business profile. Can I arrange an interview?

Best regards,
[Your name]

**Email Template:**

```
Dear [Reporter Name],

With [current season] here, I wanted to share a timely story angle for your home section:

[SPRING VERSION]
THE STORY: The window for summer pool installation is closing
Most homeowners don't realize that committing to a pool in March or April means swimming by Memorial Day, while waiting until May often means waiting until next year. Here's why:
- Permit processing takes 2-4 weeks
- Quality installers book up quickly
- Even fast fiberglass installations need 2-4 weeks
- Landscaping around the pool needs time to establish

[FALL/WINTER VERSION]
THE STORY: The smartest time to buy a pool isn't when you think
Fall and winter are actually the best times to commit to pool installation:
- Prices are typically 5-15% lower during off-season

- More time for design decisions without pressure
- Permits can be submitted early for faster approval

THE EXPERT:
Brandon Calloway of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions can explain:

- Before You Sign That Pool Contract: Expert Advice

**Email Template:**

```
Dear [Reporter Name],

Consumer protection is always relevant, and the pool industry has some unique pitfalls your readers should know about:

THE PROBLEM:
Pool installation is one of the largest home improvement purchases families make, yet many buyers sign contracts without understanding:
- What "allowances" really mean (hint: you'll pay more)
- Why the first price is rarely the final price
- How to spot a contractor who will actually show up
- What warranty terms actually protect you

THE STORY:
A consumer-focused piece on pool installation could help readers avoid thousands in unexpected costs and months of delays. Key points include:

RED FLAGS:
- Requests for more than 33% deposit (illegal in PA)
- Vague "allowances" instead of fixed prices
- No HIC (Home Improvement Contractor) registration number
- Reluctance to provide references

QUESTIONS TO ASK:
- Who will actually be on-site during construction?
- What's included vs. extra?
- What happens if you hit rock during excavation?
- What does your warranty actually cover?

THE EXPERT:
Brandon Calloway of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions operates on a transparent pricing model and can explain:
- Industry practices that hurt consumers
- How to compare quotes fairly
- Warning signs of unreliable contractors
- What good contracts look like

This would make excellent service journalism. Interested?

The company serves homeowners in Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery Counties in Pennsylvania, as well as New Castle County, Delaware. Tri-State Aquatic Solutions specializes in fiberglass pool installation, plunge pools, and premium pool equipment from industry leaders including Pentair, Hayward, and Jandy.

Brandon is committed to long-term customer relationships, offering ongoing maintenance services that extend the partnership far beyond installation. He is available for media interviews and expert commentary on pool installation, fiberglass pool technology, backyard design trends, and home improvement topics.

## Key Talking Points

### On Fiberglass Pools
- "Fiberglass technology has evolved dramatically. Today's fiberglass pools offer the same customization and luxury as concrete with a fraction of the timeline and maintenance."
- "The biggest advantage of fiberglass is respecting our customers' time. Two to four weeks from groundbreaking to swimming - that's the difference modern technology makes."
- "Fiberglass surfaces are non-porous, which means they resist algae and require fewer chemicals. Our customers spend more time enjoying their pools and less time maintaining them."

### On Timelines
- "The traditional 4-6 month concrete pool timeline isn't just inconvenient - it's unnecessary for most residential projects. Modern fiberglass installation delivers the same results in 2-4 weeks."
- "When we tell homeowners we can have them swimming in three weeks, they often don't believe us. Then they watch it happen."

### On Pricing & Transparency
- "We give our customers one price. If we quote $45,000, they pay $45,000. No change orders, no surprises, no 'allowances' that mysteriously increase."
- "The pool industry has a reputation problem when it comes to pricing. We believe transparent, fixed pricing should be the standard, not the exception."

### On Owner Involvement
- "I'm on every job site. Customers have my personal cell phone. That level of accountability doesn't exist when you're working with large national chains."
- "When the owner is personally invested in every project, quality is non-negotiable. My name is on this company."

### On Home Values
- "In affluent markets like the Main Line, a well-designed pool is increasingly expected at certain price points. It's becoming less of a luxury and more of a standard amenity."
- "The ROI on a pool depends heavily on quality. A beautifully integrated pool with proper landscaping is an asset. A poorly installed pool with cracked decking is a liability."

### On Trends
- "Plunge pools are the fastest-growing segment we're seeing. Homeowners are realizing they don't need 1,000 square feet of water to have a luxury backyard experience."
- "Smart pool technology has completely changed ownership. Our customers control everything from their phones - temperature, lighting, water features, chemical levels."

## Expert Quotes Library (20 Quotable Statements)

### On Fiberglass Technology
1. "Fiberglass isn't the budget alternative to concrete - it's the smart alternative. Lower lifetime costs, faster installation, and less maintenance."

2. "The technology behind fiberglass pools has advanced more in the last decade than in the previous fifty years. Today's options rival anything concrete can offer."

3. "Every week a pool is under construction is a week you're not swimming. Fiberglass respects our customers' time without compromising on quality."

### On Installation Process
4. "The moment a one-piece fiberglass shell is craned into place is still my favorite part of every job. Homeowners watch their backyard transform in a single afternoon."

5. "Pool installation shouldn't be an ordeal. Our goal is minimal disruption and maximum transformation."

6. "We measure our success in weeks, not months. If a pool takes six months to install, something has gone wrong."

### On Pricing & Business
7. "Transparent pricing isn't revolutionary - it's just honest. Every homeowner deserves to know exactly what they're paying for."

8. "The worst thing in our industry is the surprise change order. We eliminate that by doing our homework upfront."

9. "Pool installation is a trust-based business. That trust starts with honest pricing and ends with standing behind our work."

### On Design & Trends
10. "Small doesn't mean compromise. A well-designed plunge pool can deliver more enjoyment per square foot than a sprawling traditional pool."

11. "The best pool design is invisible - it looks like it's always been part of the backyard, not dropped in from somewhere else."

12. "Cold plunge pools have gone from niche to mainstream in about two years. Wellness isn't just happening at the gym anymore."

### On Home Value
13. "In the Main Line market, a pool isn't just an amenity - it's an expectation at certain price points. Buyers notice when it's missing."

14. "A well-designed pool is an investment. A poorly designed one is a liability. The difference comes down to quality and integration."

15. "Pool ROI depends on execution. Quality installation with proper landscaping returns 50-80% of the investment in many affluent markets."

### On Customer Experience
16. "We don't disappear after the deposit clears. Our relationship with customers extends for the life of their pool."

17. "Owner involvement isn't a marketing term - it's my personal cell phone number in every customer's contacts."

18. "The best compliment we get is referrals. When customers trust us with their friends and neighbors, we've done our job."

### On Industry
19. "The pool industry has earned its reputation problems through hidden costs and poor communication. We're trying to change that, one job at a time."

20. "I started in pool maintenance because I love the work. I expanded to installation because I got tired of hearing horror stories from my customers."
