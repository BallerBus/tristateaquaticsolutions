# 1. Crisis Communication Principles

## Core Values in Crisis

**Transparency:** Be honest about what happened, what we know, and what we don't know.

**Speed:** Respond quickly. Silence is interpreted as guilt or indifference.

**Empathy:** Acknowledge the impact on affected parties first. Don't be defensive.

**Accountability:** Take responsibility where appropriate. Don't blame others.

**Action:** Communicate what we're doing to address the situation.

## The 4R Framework

### 1. Recognize
- Acknowledge the issue exists
- Don't minimize or dismiss concerns
- Show that you understand the impact

### 2. Responsibility
- Accept appropriate accountability
- Avoid blame-shifting
- Be specific about what went wrong

### 3. Remedy
- Explain what you're doing to fix the immediate issue
- Describe steps to prevent recurrence
- Offer appropriate compensation when warranted

### 4. Recommit
- Reaffirm your values and commitment to customers
- Explain how this experience strengthens your approach
- Thank the person for bringing it to your attention

## Response Timeline Goals

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Within 1 hour** | Acknowledge receipt of complaint/issue |
| **Within 4 hours** | Initial response with empathy and next steps |
| **Within 24 hours** | Substantive response with plan/resolution |
| **Within 48 hours** | Follow-up to confirm resolution is satisfactory |

## Template 2A: Project Delay

**Situation:** Installation is running behind schedule

**Email Response:**

```
Subject: Update on Your Pool Project - [Address]

Dear [Customer Name],

I want to personally update you on the timeline for your pool project at [address].

Unfortunately, we've encountered [specific reason - weather delays, permit processing, supply chain issue] that has pushed our completion date from [original date] to [new date].

I understand this is frustrating, especially when you were looking forward to [specific milestone - swimming by Memorial Day, hosting your July 4th party, etc.]. This delay is not the experience we want for you, and I take full responsibility for communicating more proactively.

Here's what's happening now:
- [Specific action 1]
- [Specific action 2]
- [Expected next milestone and date]

I'm personally overseeing the remainder of this project to ensure we complete it as quickly as possible without compromising quality. You have my direct cell phone number, and I'm happy to provide daily updates if that would be helpful.

[If appropriate: As a gesture of our commitment to making this right, we'd like to offer [specific compensation - upgrade, discount, extended warranty, etc.].]

Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or concerns. I'm committed to delivering the beautiful pool you envisioned.

Sincerely,
Brandon Calloway
Owner, Tri-State Aquatic Solutions

1. I'll personally come to your property on [date/time - within 24-48 hours] to assess the situation firsthand.
2. Once I understand the scope, I'll provide you with a detailed plan and timeline for correction.
3. All work to remedy this issue will be completed at no additional cost to you.

Our warranty exists precisely for situations like this, and we stand behind it completely.

In the meantime, please [any immediate guidance - don't use the affected feature, etc.].

## Template 2C: Billing Dispute

**Situation:** Customer disputes a charge or believes they were overcharged

**Email Response:**

```
Subject: RE: Question About Your Invoice

Dear [Customer Name],

Thank you for reaching out about your invoice. I understand billing concerns are stressful, and I want to address this immediately.

You're right to question any charge that seems unclear. Transparent pricing is one of our core commitments, and if something doesn't make sense, I need to explain it better or correct it.

Looking at your account:
- Original contract amount: $[amount]
- [If applicable: Approved change order dated [date]: $[amount]]
- Total invoiced: $[amount]

[If the customer is correct:]
You're absolutely right - there was an error in this invoice. I've corrected it, and your revised total is $[amount]. I apologize for the confusion and any concern this caused.

[If the charge is legitimate but wasn't clearly communicated:]
I see how this charge could be confusing. Let me explain: [clear explanation of what the charge covers and why it was included]. That said, if I didn't communicate this clearly upfront, that's on me. Let's discuss how we can resolve this to your satisfaction.

[If the charge is legitimate and was clearly communicated:]
I've attached a copy of [contract/change order/approval] showing this charge was [agreed to/discussed]. However, I want to make sure you feel fairly treated. Can we schedule a call to discuss this?

Please call me directly at 610-870-3113 so we can resolve this today.

Sincerely,
Brandon Calloway
Owner, Tri-State Aquatic Solutions

## Template 2D: Property Damage

**Situation:** Construction activities damaged customer's property (landscaping, driveway, etc.)

**Email Response:**

```
Subject: Regarding the Damage to Your [Property Item]

Dear [Customer Name],

I'm deeply sorry about the damage to your [landscaping/driveway/fence/etc.]. This should not have happened, and I take full responsibility.

Here's how I'm going to make this right:

Immediate Actions:
- [Specific remediation step - e.g., "I've contacted a landscaper to replace the damaged shrubs this week"]
- [Timeline for completion]
- [Who will be handling the repair]

You will not incur any cost for this repair. This is entirely our responsibility.

I've also [spoken with the crew member responsible / implemented additional protective measures / etc.] to ensure this doesn't happen again.

I understand this adds stress to what should be an exciting project. I'm committed to restoring your property and your confidence in us.

Please let me know if there's anything else affected that I may have missed. I want to address everything completely.

## Template 2E: Subcontractor Issue

**Situation:** Problem with a subcontractor's behavior or work

**Email Response:**

```
Subject: RE: Concern About [Subcontractor/Crew]

Dear [Customer Name],

Thank you for telling me about your experience with [subcontractor/crew member]. What you've described is unacceptable, and I apologize that you were subjected to [specific behavior - rudeness, unprofessionalism, mess left behind, etc.].

When you hire Tri-State Aquatic Solutions, you're hiring me - and everyone who steps onto your property represents our company. This falls short of our standards.

What I'm doing immediately:
- [Specific action - addressing with subcontractor, removing them from project, additional supervision, etc.]
- [Going forward step]

I take full responsibility for the people working on your project. You shouldn't have to deal with this, and I'm sorry you did.

Is there anything else about this experience I should know? I want to make sure I understand the full situation so it doesn't happen again - on your project or any other.

Sincerely,
Brandon Calloway
Owner, Tri-State Aquatic Solutions
610-870-3113 (direct)

Dear [Customer Name],

I need to inform you about a development with your [permit application/inspection].

What happened:
[Clear, honest explanation of the issue - permit denied for X reason, inspection failed due to Y, additional requirements discovered, etc.]

What this means for your project:
- [Impact on timeline]
- [Any additional costs - and who is responsible]
- [Steps we're taking to resolve]

[If this is something within our control:]
I take responsibility for this. We should have [anticipated this/caught this earlier/etc.], and I apologize for the delay this causes.

[If this is outside our control:]
While this is outside our control - [township changed requirements, inspector interpretation, etc.] - I'm working to resolve it as quickly as possible.

Here's our plan:
1. [Specific action and timeline]
2. [Specific action and timeline]
