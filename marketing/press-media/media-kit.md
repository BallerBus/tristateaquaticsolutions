# Company Overview

## About Tri-State Aquatic Solutions

Tri-State Aquatic Solutions is a locally-owned pool installation and maintenance company headquartered in Hockessin, Delaware, serving affluent communities throughout Main Line Philadelphia, Chester County, Delaware County, Montgomery County, and Northern Delaware.

### Our Mission

To deliver premium pool installations with radical transparency, owner accountability, and modern technology that respects our customers' time without compromising on quality.

### Our Story

Tri-State Aquatic Solutions began as a pool maintenance company serving over 30 families across the Main Line and Northern Delaware. Through these relationships, owner Brandon Calloway repeatedly heard the same frustrations from homeowners about their pool installation experiences: hidden costs, absent contractors, and construction projects that stretched across entire seasons.

These conversations revealed a significant gap in the market - affluent homeowners who wanted premium results but couldn't find a pool company that combined local expertise with transparent pricing and accountable service. In response, Tri-State Aquatic Solutions expanded into pool installation with a fundamentally different approach.

### What Sets Us Apart

**Modern Technology, Traditional Values**

We specialize in fiberglass pool technology that delivers luxury results in 2-4 weeks rather than 4-6 months. This isn't about cutting corners - it's about using superior materials and engineering to respect our customers' time.

**Owner Involvement on Every Project**

Brandon Calloway personally oversees every installation. Customers have his direct cell phone number. This level of accountability doesn't exist at large national chains.

**Transparent, Fixed Pricing**

We provide detailed, line-item quotes with fixed pricing. No "allowances," no change orders, no surprises. If we quote $45,000, you pay $45,000.

**Lifetime Partnership**

We don't disappear after installation. Our maintenance services ensure we remain your pool partner for life, providing opening/closing services, weekly maintenance, and equipment repairs.

# Interview Talking Points

## Key Messages

### On Fiberglass Pool Technology

> "Fiberglass technology has evolved dramatically. Today's fiberglass pools offer the same customization and luxury as concrete with a fraction of the timeline and maintenance."

> "The biggest advantage of fiberglass is respecting our customers' time. Two to four weeks from groundbreaking to swimming - that's the difference modern technology makes."

> "Fiberglass surfaces are non-porous, which means they resist algae and require fewer chemicals. Our customers spend more time enjoying their pools and less time maintaining them."

### On Installation Timelines

> "The traditional 4-6 month concrete pool timeline isn't just inconvenient - it's unnecessary for most residential projects. Modern fiberglass installation delivers the same results in 2-4 weeks."

> "When we tell homeowners we can have them swimming in three weeks, they often don't believe us. Then they watch it happen."

> "We measure our success in weeks, not months. If a pool takes six months to install, something has gone wrong."

### On Transparent Pricing

> "We give our customers one price. If we quote $45,000, they pay $45,000. No change orders, no surprises, no 'allowances' that mysteriously increase."

> "The pool industry has a reputation problem when it comes to pricing. We believe transparent, fixed pricing should be the standard, not the exception."

> "Transparent pricing isn't revolutionary - it's just honest. Every homeowner deserves to know exactly what they're paying for."

### On Owner Involvement

> "I'm on every job site. Customers have my personal cell phone. That level of accountability doesn't exist when you're working with large national chains."

> "When the owner is personally invested in every project, quality is non-negotiable. My name is on this company."

> "Owner involvement isn't a marketing term - it's my personal cell phone number in every customer's contacts."

### On Home Values

> "In affluent markets like the Main Line, a well-designed pool is increasingly expected at certain price points. Buyers notice when it's missing."

> "A well-designed pool is an investment. A poorly designed one is a liability. The difference comes down to quality and integration."

> "Pool ROI depends on execution. Quality installation with proper landscaping returns 50-80% of the investment in many affluent markets."

### On Market Trends

> "Plunge pools are the fastest-growing segment we're seeing. Homeowners are realizing they don't need 1,000 square feet of water to have a luxury backyard experience."

> "Smart pool technology has completely changed ownership. Our customers control everything from their phones - temperature, lighting, water features, chemical levels."

> "Cold plunge pools have gone from niche to mainstream in about two years. Wellness isn't just happening at the gym anymore."

### On Customer Experience

> "We don't disappear after the deposit clears. Our relationship with customers extends for the life of their pool."

> "The best compliment we get is referrals. When customers trust us with their friends and neighbors, we've done our job."

### On the Industry

> "The pool industry has earned its reputation problems through hidden costs and poor communication. We're trying to change that, one job at a time."

> "I started in pool maintenance because I love the work. I expanded to installation because I got tired of hearing horror stories from my customers."
