## Notes and Reminders

### Media Outreach Best Practices

1. **Research first** - Read their recent work before pitching
2. **Personalize every pitch** - Reference specific articles
3. **Respect deadlines** - Never pitch during breaking news
4. **Be responsive** - Reply within hours, not days
5. **Follow up once** - Don't spam with multiple follow-ups
6. **Build relationships** - Be helpful even when not seeking coverage
7. **Say thank you** - Always thank them for coverage
8. **Share their work** - Amplify their articles on your channels

### Editorial Calendar Awareness

- Most print publications work 2-4 months ahead
- Home & Garden issues typically planned in winter
- Best of awards typically mid-year
- Summer issues planned in spring
- Digital outlets have shorter lead times

### Local vs. National Strategy

**Local First:** Build relationships with local media before pitching national outlets. Local coverage:
- Easier to secure
- More relevant to target customers
- Builds credibility for national pitches
- Creates portfolio of coverage
