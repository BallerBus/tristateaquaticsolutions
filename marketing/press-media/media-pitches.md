# 1. Story Angle Pitches for Local Media

## Pitch 1A: Local Business Success Story

**Subject Line Options:**
- Local Entrepreneur Bets on Pool Industry Disruption
- From Pool Maintenance to Installation: A Small Business Growth Story
- Main Line's New Pool Company Focuses on What Big Chains Miss

**Email:**

```
Dear [Reporter Name],

I'm reaching out about a potential local business profile: a Hockessin entrepreneur who's challenging how the pool industry operates.

THE STORY:
Brandon Calloway started Tri-State Aquatic Solutions as a pool maintenance company serving 30+ families. He noticed something troubling: homeowners consistently shared horror stories about their pool installation experiences - hidden costs, absent contractors, and projects that dragged on for months.

So he expanded into installation with a fundamentally different approach:
- Transparent, fixed pricing (no change orders)
- Owner involvement on every job site (not a rotating crew of subcontractors)
- 2-4 week timelines using modern fiberglass technology
- Lifetime ongoing relationship (installation AND maintenance)

THE COMPETITIVE ANGLE:
The pool industry is dominated by large national chains with mixed reputations. Calloway's bet is that affluent homeowners will pay for personalized service and accountability.

THE PROFILE:
Brandon can discuss:
- Building a business in a market dominated by larger players
- Why he chose fiberglass over traditional concrete
- The challenges of scaling a service business
- His vision for the company's future

This would make a strong local business profile. Can I arrange an interview?

Best regards,
Brandon Calloway

## Pitch 1B: Consumer Protection Angle

**Subject Line Options:**
- 5 Red Flags When Hiring a Pool Contractor
- What Pool Salespeople Don't Tell You
- Before You Sign That Pool Contract: Expert Advice

**Email:**

```
Dear [Reporter Name],

Consumer protection is always relevant, and the pool industry has some unique pitfalls your readers should know about.

THE PROBLEM:
Pool installation is one of the largest home improvement purchases families make, yet many buyers sign contracts without understanding:
- What "allowances" really mean (hint: you'll pay more)
- Why the first price is rarely the final price
- How to spot a contractor who will actually show up
- What warranty terms actually protect you

THE STORY:
A consumer-focused piece on pool installation could help readers avoid thousands in unexpected costs and months of delays.

RED FLAGS:
- Requests for more than 33% deposit (illegal in PA)
- Vague "allowances" instead of fixed prices
- No HIC (Home Improvement Contractor) registration number
- Reluctance to provide references

QUESTIONS TO ASK:
- Who will actually be on-site during construction?
- What's included vs. extra?
- What happens if you hit rock during excavation?
- What does your warranty actually cover?

THE EXPERT:
Brandon Calloway of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions operates on a transparent pricing model and can explain:
- Industry practices that hurt consumers
- How to compare quotes fairly
- Warning signs of unreliable contractors
- What good contracts look like

This would make excellent service journalism. Interested?

Best regards,
Brandon Calloway

## Pitch 1C: Real Estate Angle

**Subject Line Options:**
- Does a Pool Add Value in Pennsylvania? The Answer May Surprise You
- The ROI Question Every Pool Buyer Should Ask
- Real Estate + Pool: What Main Line Buyers Need to Know

**Email:**

```
Dear [Reporter Name],

With spring real estate season approaching, I wanted to share a story angle that affects thousands of your readers: the real impact of pools on home values in our region.

THE STORY:
The conventional wisdom that "pools don't add value" may not apply to affluent markets like the Main Line. Local experts are seeing:
- Premium homes with pools selling faster in many neighborhoods
- Buyer expectations shifting (pools becoming "expected" at certain price points)
- ROI ranging from 50-80% of installation cost, with higher returns in luxury markets

THE NUANCE:
The value equation depends heavily on:
- Neighborhood norms and lot sizes
- Pool type and condition
- Quality of installation and landscaping integration

THE DATA:
- Main Line median family income: $192,630
- Chester County median home value: $554,474
- Average pool ROI: 5-7%
- Home value increase with pool: 8-11.5%

THE EXPERT:
Brandon Calloway of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions works closely with realtors across the Main Line and can provide:
- Perspective on what's selling in different price brackets
- Tips for homeowners considering selling with or without a pool
- Design decisions that maximize resale value
- Common mistakes that hurt rather than help home values

Would this make a good piece for your real estate or home sections?

Best regards,
Brandon Calloway
610-870-3113

**Subject Line Options:**
- The Wellness Trend That's Hitting Main Line Backyards
- Why Everyone Is Suddenly Talking About Cold Plunges
- From Gym to Backyard: The Home Wellness Revolution

**Email:**

```
Dear [Reporter Name],

I noticed your recent coverage of [wellness/fitness/lifestyle trends] and wanted to suggest a related story: the explosion of cold plunge pools in residential backyards.

THE TREND:
Cold water immersion has gone mainstream, driven by:
- High-profile advocates (Andrew Huberman, Joe Rogan, etc.)
- Growing research on recovery and mental health benefits
- Post-COVID emphasis on home wellness amenities

THE LOCAL STORY:
Affluent Main Line homeowners are increasingly requesting:
- Dedicated cold plunge pools for daily wellness routines
- Combined hot spa/cold plunge setups
- Year-round temperature-controlled pools

THE DATA:
- Plunge pool inquiries have increased significantly over the past year
- Average installation cost: $15,000-$25,000 for dedicated unit
- Many homeowners adding cold plunge zones to existing pool renovations

THE EXPERT:
Brandon Calloway of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions can discuss:
- What homeowners are requesting and why
- Design options for different budgets
- The technology behind temperature-controlled pools
- Who's buying (demographics, motivations)

This would connect well with your health/wellness coverage. Can I arrange an interview?

Best regards,
Brandon Calloway
610-870-3113
```

## Pitch 1E: Technology/Innovation Angle

**Subject Line Options:**
- Your Smartphone Can Now Control Your Pool
- The Tech That's Making Pool Ownership Effortless
- Smart Pools: When Silicon Valley Meets the Backyard

**Email:**

```
Dear [Reporter Name],

Given your coverage of smart home technology, I thought you'd be interested in one area that's often overlooked: pool automation and connectivity.

THE TECH STORY:
Modern pools bear little resemblance to the high-maintenance money pits of previous generations. Today's pool owners can:
- Control heating, lighting, and water features from their phones
- Receive automatic alerts when chemistry is off-balance
- Monitor energy usage in real-time
- Integrate pool functions with home automation systems (Alexa, Google Home)

THE EQUIPMENT:
Systems from Pentair, Hayward, and Jandy now offer app-controlled automation:
- Variable-speed pumps that cut energy costs by 50-70%
- LED lighting with millions of color options
- Automated chemical dosing for perfect water balance
- Solar heating integration

THE LOCAL EXPERT:
Brandon Calloway of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions installs these systems daily and can demonstrate:
- Live pool control via smartphone
- Energy savings data from local installations
- How automation changes the ownership experience
- What's coming next in pool technology

This would fit well in your tech or lifestyle coverage. Can I arrange a demonstration?

Best regards,
Brandon Calloway

## Pitch 2B: News Feature - Technology Segment

**Subject Line:** Segment Idea: Smart Pools - Technology Comes to the Backyard

Dear [Producer Name],

SEGMENT CONCEPT: "Smart Pools: Control Your Pool from Your Phone"
LENGTH: 2-3 minutes
FORMAT: On-location demonstration

LOGISTICS:
We can arrange access to a private home with a fully-automated pool system, or demonstrate at our showroom/office setting. Brandon Calloway is camera-ready and can provide clear demonstrations.

Interested in discussing further?

Best regards,
Brandon Calloway
610-870-3113

## Pitch 2C: Weekend Lifestyle Segment

**Subject Line:** Segment Idea: Backyard Transformation in 2 Weeks

**Email:**

```
Dear [Producer Name],

I'd like to pitch a visual-heavy segment showing how modern pool installation has transformed from a months-long ordeal into a rapid backyard makeover.

SEGMENT CONCEPT: "From Yard to Oasis: The 2-Week Pool Transformation"
LENGTH: 3-4 minutes
FORMAT: On-location feature

THE VISUAL HOOK:
Viewers will be amazed to see a one-piece fiberglass pool shell lifted by crane and dropped into a prepared excavation. It's dramatic, it's unexpected, and it completely changes how people think about pool installation.

ACCESS WE CAN PROVIDE:
- Crane delivery day (the dramatic "money shot")
- Before/during/after footage of complete project
- Homeowner interview about their experience
- Time-lapse of entire installation process

STORY ARC:
1. Before: Empty backyard with potential

5. Completion: Family enjoying their new pool

THE EXPERT:
Brandon Calloway can narrate the process, explain the technology, and discuss why this approach is gaining popularity among busy Main Line families.

TIMING:
We can coordinate this segment around an upcoming installation (typically scheduling 2-4 weeks out). I can provide advance notice of our crane delivery dates.

This would make excellent weekend lifestyle content. Interested in discussing?

Best regards,
Brandon Calloway
610-870-3113

## Pitch 2D: Consumer News Segment

**Subject Line:** Consumer Alert: Pool Contract Red Flags

**Email:**

```
Dear [Producer Name],

With pool season approaching, I'd like to pitch a consumer protection segment helping viewers avoid common pool installation pitfalls.

SEGMENT CONCEPT: "Before You Sign: Pool Contract Red Flags"
LENGTH: 2-3 minutes
FORMAT: In-studio or on-location

THE NEWS HOOK:
Pool installation complaints are among the most common home improvement disputes. Many homeowners sign contracts without understanding warning signs that lead to cost overruns, delays, and disputes.

KEY POINTS FOR VIEWERS:
1. In PA, contractors can't request more than 33% deposit (many violate this)
2. "Allowances" are code for "you'll pay more later"
3. No HIC registration number = unlicensed contractor
4. Vague timelines and absent contractors are the #1 complaint
5. What warranties actually cover (and what they don't)

VISUAL AIDS:
- Side-by-side comparison: Good contract vs. problematic contract
- Checklist graphic: Questions to ask before signing
- Warning signs graphic: Red flags in pool contracts

THE EXPERT:
Brandon Calloway of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions operates on a transparent pricing model and can explain industry practices from an insider perspective - what to watch for and how to protect yourself.

# 3. Podcast Interview Pitches

## Pitch 3A: Business/Entrepreneurship Podcasts

**Subject Line:** Guest Pitch: Building a Local Business Against National Chains

**Email:**

```
Hi [Host Name],

I'm a listener of [Podcast Name] and particularly enjoyed your episode on [specific episode]. [One sentence connecting to their content].

I'm reaching out because I think my story and expertise could make for an interesting conversation with your audience.

QUICK INTRO:
I'm Brandon Calloway, owner of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions, a pool installation company in the Philadelphia area. I transitioned from pool maintenance to installation after seeing how poorly the industry was treating homeowners - hidden costs, disappearing contractors, and six-month construction timelines.

WHAT I CAN DISCUSS:
- Competing against national chains as a small local company
- Building trust through radical pricing transparency
- Why I bet on fiberglass technology when everyone else was doing concrete
- The challenges of scaling a service business
- How I turned customer complaints about competitors into my business model

WHY YOUR AUDIENCE WOULD CARE:
Your listeners understand that industries ripe for disruption often look unexciting from the outside. Pool installation isn't sexy, but it's a $13 billion industry with serious service problems. That's where opportunity lives.

I'm happy to provide any additional information. Thanks for considering!

Best,
Brandon Calloway
Tri-State Aquatic Solutions

## Pitch 3E: Real Estate Podcasts

**Subject Line:** Guest Pitch: Do Pools Actually Add Home Value?

**Email:**

```
Hi [Host Name],

I've been enjoying [Podcast Name] and thought your audience might appreciate a deep dive on a question that comes up constantly: do pools actually add home value?

QUICK INTRO:
I'm Brandon Calloway, owner of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions. I work closely with realtors across the Main Line Philadelphia area and have a lot of insight into how pools affect home sales.

WHAT I CAN DISCUSS:
- The real data on pool ROI (it's more nuanced than "yes" or "no")
- How affluent markets like the Main Line differ from average markets
- When pools help sales vs. when they hurt
- Design decisions that maximize resale value
- What I hear from realtors about pool homes
- The buyer expectation shift at certain price points

THE NUANCE:
This isn't a simple "pools add X% to home value" answer. Your listeners will get the actual complexity and learn how to think about pools as investments rather than just amenities.

LOCAL DATA:
- Main Line median family income: $192,630
- Chester County median home value: $554,474
- Average pool ROI: 5-7%, but higher in luxury markets

Would love to discuss further.

Best,
Brandon Calloway

# 4. Print Feature Pitches

## Pitch 4A: Trend Feature - Plunge Pools

**Subject Line Options:**
- Story Idea: Why Main Line Homeowners Are Going Smaller with Their Pools
- The Plunge Pool Revolution Hitting Philadelphia Suburbs
- Think Your Yard Is Too Small? The Pool Trend Proving Otherwise

**Email:**

```
Dear [Reporter Name],

I noticed your recent coverage of [relevant topic/home design/local trends] and thought you might be interested in a story about a surprising trend reshaping backyards across the Main Line: plunge pools.

THE TREND:
Small-footprint "plunge pools" (typically under 400 square feet) are surging in popularity among affluent homeowners who previously thought their yards were too small for a pool. These compact pools deliver full luxury features - heated water, LED lighting, custom finishes - in a fraction of the space.

THE LOCAL ANGLE:
- Main Line homes on 1/4 to 1/2 acre lots are ideal candidates
- Cold plunge wellness trend is driving adoption among health-conscious buyers
- Installation takes just 2-3 weeks with minimal yard disruption
- Starting price around $35,000 vs. $60,000+ for traditional pools

THE EXPERT:
Brandon Calloway, owner of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions in Hockessin, has seen plunge pool inquiries triple over the past year. He can provide:
- Before/after photos of local plunge pool installations
- Cost comparisons and design options
- Interview availability for photos/video at active job sites

Would you be interested in exploring this trend for your readers? I'm happy to arrange a conversation with Brandon or coordinate a site visit to a current project.

Best regards,
Brandon Calloway

## Pitch 4B: Technology Feature

**Subject Line Options:**
- The Pool Material 90% of Homeowners Don't Know About
- Why Smart Main Line Buyers Are Skipping Concrete Pools
- 2 Weeks vs. 6 Months: The Pool Technology Changing Everything

**Email:**

```
Dear [Reporter Name],

I'm reaching out with a story idea that might surprise your readers: the pools being installed across the Main Line in 2026 look nothing like the pools their parents built.

THE SHIFT:
Fiberglass pools have quietly captured over 60% of the residential pool market, yet most homeowners still assume concrete is their only option. The technology has evolved dramatically, offering:
- Installation in 2-4 weeks (vs. 4-6 months for concrete)
- 50% lower lifetime maintenance costs
- Smoother, non-porous surfaces that resist algae
- Built-in luxury features (tanning ledges, spa spillovers, custom lighting)

WHY THIS MATTERS LOCALLY:
Main Line homeowners are busy professionals who can't afford to have their backyards under construction for half a year. Fiberglass technology respects their time without sacrificing quality.

THE EXPERT SOURCE:
Brandon Calloway of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions can walk you through a side-by-side comparison and explain:
- Why contractors don't always mention fiberglass
- How fiberglass pools handle our PA/DE climate and soil
- Real cost comparisons from recent local installations
- The innovations making fiberglass look as custom as concrete

This would make an excellent piece for homeowners planning spring renovations.

Best regards,
Brandon Calloway

## Pitch 4C: Home & Garden Feature - Visual Transformation

**Subject Line Options:**
- From Hole in the Ground to Swimming: How 2-Week Pools Work
- Your Backyard, Transformed in Two Weeks
- The Construction Timeline That's Shocking Pool Buyers

**Email:**

```
Dear [Reporter Name],

What if I told you a complete, luxury pool installation could happen in the time most contractors take to "get started" on a concrete pool?

THE STORY:
Modern pool installation has been revolutionized by fiberglass and pre-manufactured pool technology. A typical installation now looks like:

WEEK 1: Excavation, shell delivery, positioning
WEEK 2: Plumbing, electrical, equipment installation
WEEK 3-4: Decking, landscaping, startup

Compare that to the 4-6 month ordeal of a gunite/concrete pool.

VISUAL OPPORTUNITY:
I can coordinate access to an active installation site where your photographer could capture:
- The dramatic moment of a one-piece fiberglass shell being craned into place
- Before/during/after shots of a complete transformation
- The homeowners' reaction to their finished pool

THE EXPERT:
Brandon Calloway, owner of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions, can walk through the entire process and explain why speed doesn't mean cutting corners. He's available for on-site interviews during active installations.

This would make compelling visual content for your spring home improvement coverage.

Best regards,
Brandon Calloway

## Pitch 4D: Business Profile

**Subject Line:** Story Idea: Local Entrepreneur Challenges National Pool Chains

**Email:**

```
Dear [Reporter Name],

I'd like to pitch a business profile on a local entrepreneur who's built his company around fixing everything the national pool chains do wrong.

THE STORY:
Brandon Calloway started Tri-State Aquatic Solutions as a pool maintenance company. Through 30+ customer relationships, he consistently heard the same complaints about pool installation: surprise costs, absent contractors, projects dragging on for seasons.

His response: build an installation company on the opposite principles.
- Transparent, fixed pricing (no change orders, period)
- Owner involvement on every project (his cell phone in every contract)
- Modern technology (2-4 weeks, not 6 months)

THE BUSINESS ANGLE:
This is a classic small business vs. big business story, but with real stakes. Pool installation is a $13 billion industry dominated by large players with documented service problems. Calloway's bet is that affluent homeowners will pay for accountability.

INTERVIEW TOPICS:
- Building a business against larger competitors
- The economics of transparent pricing
- Why he chose fiberglass technology
- Growth plans and challenges
- Lessons from years of maintenance customer relationships

This would make a strong local business profile.

Best regards,
Brandon Calloway

## Pitch 5C: Trend Commentary - Home Values

**Subject Line:** Expert Available: Pools and Home Values in PA/DE Market

**Email:**

```
Dear [Reporter Name],

Given your coverage of the local real estate market, I wanted to offer an expert perspective on how pools affect home values - a topic that comes up frequently as spring approaches.

THE NUANCE:
The conventional wisdom that "pools don't add value" doesn't apply uniformly. In affluent markets like the Main Line, the equation is more complex:

LOCAL DATA:
- Main Line median family income: $192,630
- Chester County median home value: $554,474
- Average pool ROI: 5-7% (higher in luxury markets)
- Home value increase with pool: 8-11.5% in some markets

- When pools help vs. hurt home sales
- Buyer expectations at different price points
- Design decisions that affect resale value
- The Main Line market specifically

He's available for phone interviews or written quotes.

## Pitch 5D: Seasonal Commentary - Spring/Fall

**Subject Line:** Expert Available: [Spring Pool Planning / Fall Pool Buying] Advice

**Email:**

```
Dear [Reporter Name],

As [spring/fall] approaches, I wanted to offer expert commentary on pool installation timing for your readers.

[SPRING VERSION:]
THE STORY: The window for summer pool installation is closing
Most homeowners don't realize that committing in March or April means swimming by Memorial Day, while waiting until May often means waiting until next year.

[FALL VERSION:]
THE STORY: The smartest time to buy a pool isn't when you think
Fall and winter are actually the best times to commit to pool installation, offering better pricing and priority spring scheduling.

THE EXPERT:
Brandon Calloway of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions can explain:
- The real timeline from decision to swimming
- How to avoid the spring rush
- Pricing advantages of off-season commitment
- What homeowners should do now

He's available for phone interviews or written quotes to help your readers make informed decisions.

Hi [Name],

Thanks for your time.

Best,
Brandon Calloway
