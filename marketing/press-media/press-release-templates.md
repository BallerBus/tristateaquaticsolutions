TRI-STATE AQUATIC SOLUTIONS LAUNCHES PREMIUM POOL INSTALLATION SERVICES FOR MAIN LINE PHILADELPHIA

Hockessin-Based Company Brings Modern Fiberglass Technology and Transparent Pricing to Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery Counties

HOCKESSIN, DE (February 2026) - Tri-State Aquatic Solutions today announced the official launch of its premium pool installation services, bringing modern fiberglass pool technology to homeowners throughout Main Line Philadelphia and Northern Delaware.

Founded by Brandon Calloway, Tri-State Aquatic Solutions addresses common homeowner frustrations with traditional pool installation: hidden costs, lengthy timelines, and absent contractors. The company's approach centers on transparent fixed pricing, owner involvement on every project, and fiberglass technology that delivers luxury results in 2-4 weeks rather than the 4-6 months typical of concrete pool construction.

"Main Line homeowners deserve a pool installation experience that respects their time and their budget," said Calloway. "We've built our company on a simple principle: tell people exactly what they're paying for and deliver exactly what we promise."

Key features of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions' service include:

- 2-4 week installation timeline using advanced fiberglass technology
- Transparent, fixed pricing with no change orders or hidden fees
- Owner involvement on every job site
- Premium equipment from Pentair, Hayward, and Jandy
- Lifetime warranty on pool shell structural integrity
- Ongoing maintenance services for long-term partnership

The company serves homeowners in Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery Counties in Pennsylvania, as well as New Castle County in Delaware. Services include fiberglass pool installation, plunge pools, pool and spa combinations, and full maintenance services.

LOCAL POOL EXPERT REVEALS TOP BACKYARD POOL TRENDS FOR [YEAR]

From Plunge Pools to Smart Technology, Main Line Homeowners Are Transforming Outdoor Living

HOCKESSIN, DE ([DATE]) - As homeowners begin planning outdoor projects for [YEAR], local pool installation expert Brandon Calloway of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions shares the top pool trends shaping backyard design in the coming season.

**1. Plunge Pools Continue to Dominate**
"Not every yard needs an Olympic-sized pool," says Calloway. "Plunge pools - compact pools typically under 400 square feet - are ideal for Main Line lots where space is at a premium but luxury expectations remain high."

**2. Fiberglass Gains Ground Over Concrete**
Installation times for fiberglass pools average 2-4 weeks versus 4-6 months for concrete. "Busy professionals don't want their backyard torn up for half a year. Fiberglass delivers the same luxury aesthetic with a fraction of the disruption."

**3. Year-Round Wellness Features**
Cold plunge pools and heated spa combinations allow homeowners to use their pools throughout all four seasons, supporting the growing wellness trend.

**4. Smart Pool Technology Goes Mainstream**
Automated systems from brands like Pentair and Hayward allow pool owners to control temperature, lighting, and chemistry from their smartphones. "What was considered high-end five years ago is now expected at every price point."

**5. Sustainable Design Priorities**
Energy-efficient variable-speed pumps, LED lighting, and solar heating options reflect homeowners' growing interest in environmentally responsible choices.

"Pool design has evolved dramatically in the past five years," notes Calloway. "Today's homeowners want speed, efficiency, and sustainability without compromising on luxury."

Brandon Calloway is available for interviews and expert commentary on pool trends, installation processes, and backyard design.

LOCAL POOL EXPERT: DEADLINE APPROACHING FOR SUMMER POOL INSTALLATION

Homeowners Must Commit by [DATE] for Memorial Day Swimming

HOCKESSIN, DE ([DATE]) - Main Line homeowners hoping to swim in a new pool this summer are running out of time, according to local pool installation expert Brandon Calloway of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions.

"There's a common misconception that you can decide on a pool in May and be swimming by July," says Calloway. "The reality is that permit processing, design finalization, and contractor scheduling require a much earlier commitment."

The timeline for summer pool installation:
- Permit processing: 2-4 weeks
- Design and contract finalization: 1-2 weeks
- Fiberglass installation: 2-4 weeks
- Decking and landscaping: 1-2 weeks
- Buffer for weather delays: 1-2 weeks

"Homeowners who want to be swimming by Memorial Day should already have signed contracts," Calloway advises. "Those deciding now are more realistically looking at June or early July completion."

Tips for homeowners considering a pool:

1. **Start now**: Schedule consultations immediately, even if you're not 100% committed
2. **Understand permit timelines**: Municipal approval varies significantly by township
3. **Ask about fiberglass**: Modern fiberglass installation is significantly faster than concrete
4. **Get multiple quotes**: But compare apples to apples - ask about what's included
5. **Check contractor credentials**: Verify licensing, insurance, and references

"The best time to have started planning was January," Calloway notes. "The second best time is today. But waiting until May means waiting until next year in many cases."

Brandon Calloway is available for interviews on pool installation timing, planning considerations, and contractor selection.

LOCAL POOL EXPERT: FALL IS THE SMARTEST TIME TO BUY A POOL

Off-Season Advantages Include Lower Prices and Priority Spring Installation Slots

HOCKESSIN, DE ([DATE]) - Contrary to popular belief, fall and winter represent the ideal time to commit to a pool installation, according to local pool expert Brandon Calloway of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions.

"Everyone thinks about pools when the weather warms up," says Calloway. "But the smartest buyers are signing contracts right now, in the fall."

Advantages of off-season pool purchasing:

**1. Better Pricing**
"Off-season buyers can often secure 5-15% savings compared to spring and summer pricing. Contractors are more willing to negotiate when demand is lower."

**2. Priority Scheduling**
"Spring installation slots fill up fast. Buyers who commit in fall get first choice of installation dates, ensuring they'll actually be swimming by Memorial Day."

**3. Time for Better Decisions**
"Without the pressure of summer approaching, homeowners can take time with design decisions, compare options thoughtfully, and avoid rushed choices they might regret."

**4. Permit Head Start**
"Submitting permits now means approval is in hand when construction season begins. No waiting in the spring queue."

**5. Landscaping Integration**
"Early planning allows for better integration with landscaping, which needs time to establish. Fall contracts mean spring planting around a finished pool."

"The pool industry has conditioned homeowners to think seasonally," Calloway notes. "But experienced buyers know that the best deals and the smoothest experiences happen when everyone else is focused on football and fall foliage."

Brandon Calloway is available for interviews on pool buying timing, off-season advantages, and planning for spring installation.
