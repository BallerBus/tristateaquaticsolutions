### Yes, You Can Have a Pool This Summer

If you're reading this, you're probably wondering: *Can I really add a pool to my new home? How much does it cost? How long does it take?*

**Good news: It's easier than you think.**

---

### The Real Timeline

Forget what you've heard about pools taking "forever" to install.

**Modern fiberglass pool installation:**

| Excavation & Shell | 1 week |
| Plumbing & Electrical | 1-2 weeks |
| Decking & Finishing | 1-2 weeks |
| **Total** | **6-10 weeks** |

**If you start now, you could be swimming by [insert month based on season].**

---

### The Real Cost

Pool pricing is more transparent than you'd expect.

| Pool Size | Typical Price Range |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Small (12x24 - 14x28) | $40,000 - $55,000 |
| Medium (15x30 - 16x32) | $55,000 - $75,000 |
| Large (18x36+) | $75,000 - $100,000+ |

**What's included:**

### The Real Value

Pools aren't just for fun - they're investments.

**In Main Line PA and Chester County:**

- Homes with pools sell **faster**
- Buyers actively search for pool homes
