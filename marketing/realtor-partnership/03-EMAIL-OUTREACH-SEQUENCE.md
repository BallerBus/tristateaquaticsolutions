# Realtor Email Outreach Sequence
## 5-Email Campaign for Tri-State Aquatic Solutions

---

## Campaign Overview

**Goal:** Establish partnerships with Main Line PA and Northern Delaware real estate agents
**Target:** Luxury and mid-market residential agents in our service area
**Sequence:** 5 emails over 21 days
**Expected Response Rate:** 8-15% (based on industry benchmarks for B2B outreach)

---

# Email 1: Introduction
## Day 0 - First Contact

---

**Subject Line Options (A/B test):**
- A: Pool installations for your Main Line clients
- B: A partnership that pays you $2,000+ per referral
- C: [First Name], quick question about your clients

---

**Email Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this brief - I know you're busy showing homes and closing deals.

**The short version:** I run a premium pool installation company in Main Line PA and Northern Delaware. I'm looking to partner with a few respected local agents for mutual referrals.

**What's in it for you:**
- 3% referral fee on every pool we install for your clients
- Average pool: $60,000 = $1,800 for you
- Plus: You become the agent who "knows someone" for everything

**Why this works:**
Your clients buy beautiful homes without pools. They ask you, "Know anyone who installs pools?" You do. We do the work. They love their new pool. You look like a hero. You get paid.

I'm not asking for a meeting yet - just wondering if this is something you'd consider.

**One question:** How many of your clients each year ask about pool installation?

Hit reply and let me know. I'll send you more details if it sounds interesting.

Best,

P.S. - I've attached a one-page overview of how pools impact home values in our market. Might be useful for your seller conversations.

# Email 2: Value Proposition Follow-Up
## Day 3 - Deepening Interest

---

**Subject Line Options:**
- A: Re: Pool installations for your Main Line clients
- B: The math on pool referrals (it's better than you'd think)
- C: Quick follow-up - 3 minutes of your time

---

**Email Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my email from a few days ago about partnering on pool referrals.

I wanted to share some numbers that might be relevant to your business:

**The Market Reality:**
- Main Line home values: $470,000 - $550,000 median
- Homes with pools sell for $50,000 - $100,000 more
- Pool search is a TOP 10 filter on Zillow
- Buyers are actively looking for pool-ready properties

**The Agent Opportunity:**
Let's say you close 30 transactions this year. Conservative estimate: 10% of your buyers will ask about pools. That's 3 referrals.

At $60,000 average pool value x 3% = **$5,400 in passive income.**

For doing nothing more than making an introduction.

**What makes us different:**
- **Local:** I live and work in this market (not a national franchise)
- **Fast:** Fiberglass pools install in 2-4 weeks, not 6 months
- **Transparent:** One price quote, no surprise change orders
- **Reliable:** I personally oversee every installation

**No risk to you:** If your client doesn't move forward, you owe nothing. Commission only on completed projects.

Worth a conversation?

Reply with "yes" and I'll send you a few times to chat. Or call me direct: 610-870-3113.

# Email 3: Success Story Share
## Day 7 - Social Proof

---

**Subject Line Options:**
- A: How one agent made $9,000 in pool referrals last year
- B: "My clients couldn't stop thanking me"
- C: Real story: Pool referral + happy client + paid agent

---

**Email Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to share a quick story from one of our realtor partners.

**The Situation:**
Sarah M. (Keller Williams, Main Line) sold a beautiful 4-bedroom in Bryn Mawr last spring. Great home, big backyard, no pool. Her buyers mentioned wanting to add one eventually.

**What Sarah Did:**
Instead of saying "I'll ask around," she texted me. Three-way introduction. Done.

**What Happened:**
- We met with her clients within 48 hours
- Custom design: 16x32 fiberglass with spa
- Total project: $72,000
- Installation completed in 10 weeks
- Clients moved in June 1, swimming by July 4

**The Results:**
- Her clients sent her a glowing testimonial
- They've since referred two friends to her
- She earned $2,160 referral fee
- Total referrals that year: 5 pools = **$9,000**

**Her quote:** "I used to just say 'I don't know anyone' when clients asked about pools. Now I have an answer - and it pays."

[First Name], I'm not promising you $9,000 next year. But I am promising that every client you send my way will be treated like family, and you'll get paid for the introduction.

Sound fair?

Let me know if you want to chat.

Brandon

P.S. - Sarah's happy to speak with you if you want a reference. Just let me know.

# Email 4: Partnership Proposal
## Day 14 - The Ask

---

**Subject Line Options:**
- A: Partnership proposal for [First Name]
- B: Let's make this official
- C: Exclusive: Pool partner spots in [Area]

---

**Email Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times about pool referral partnerships, and I wanted to make a formal proposal.

**The Tri-State Realtor Partner Program:**

**What You Get:**
1. **3% referral fee** on all completed pool installations
2. **Priority scheduling** for your clients (bumped to front of queue)
3. **48-hour consultations** guaranteed
4. **Co-branded materials** you can use at open houses
5. **Status updates** so you always know what's happening with your referral
6. **No exclusivity** - partner with others if you want (but you won't need to)

**What You Do:**
1. When a client asks about pools, text or email me their info
2. That's it. We handle everything else.

**The Numbers:**
- Average pool: $60,000
- Your fee: $1,800
- Average partner referrals: 3-5/year
- Your annual income: $5,400 - $9,000

**No Contract Required:**
This isn't a binding agreement. You send referrals when you have them. We pay you when pools are completed. Simple.

**Limited Availability:**
I'm only partnering with 10 agents per market area. I want to give each partner enough attention and priority scheduling. Once I hit 10 in Main Line, I'm closing new partnerships.

**Interested?**
Reply "I'm in" and I'll send you a welcome packet with everything you need - business cards, brochures, your unique referral code, and a direct line to me.

Or call me: 610-870-3113

Let's make this happen.

# Email 5: Final Outreach
## Day 21 - Last Chance

---

**Subject Line Options:**
- A: Last email from me (promise)
- B: Final call: Pool partnership opportunity
- C: Closing the loop, [First Name]

---

**Email Body:**

Hi [First Name],

This is my last email - I don't want to clutter your inbox.

I've reached out several times about partnering on pool referrals. If the timing isn't right or it's not a fit, no worries at all. I'll take the hint.

But before I move on, let me leave you with this:

**The Question:**
How many times in the past year has a client asked you, "Do you know anyone who installs pools?"

If the answer is more than zero, you're leaving money on the table.

**The Offer:**
- 3% of every pool we install for your referrals
- Average payout: $1,800 per pool
- Zero effort: just make an introduction
- Zero risk: if they don't buy, you owe nothing

**The Deadline:**
I'm finalizing my realtor partner roster for this season by [Date: 2 weeks from send]. After that, I won't be accepting new partners until next year.

**One Last Ask:**
If this interests you even a little, just reply with "maybe" and I'll give you a call to answer any questions. No pressure, no pitch - just a conversation.

If not, I genuinely wish you a great selling season. Maybe our paths will cross another way.

Best of luck out there.

## For Various Response Scenarios

### Response: "Tell me more"

Subject: Here's everything you need, [First Name]

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for your interest! I'm attaching our full Realtor Partnership Packet - it covers:

- How referrals work (super simple)
- Commission structure (3% of project value)
- FAQs from other agents
- Pool value data for our market

The quick version: You send me a client, I take care of everything, you get paid when the pool is done.

Want to jump on a quick call? I'm free [provide 2-3 times]. Or just reply with questions and I'll answer via email.

Looking forward to working together.

Brandon

### Response: "What's the catch?"

Subject: Re: What's the catch?

Hi [First Name],

Fair question. Here's the honest answer:

**There is no catch.** Here's why this works for me:

1. Pool installations are $50-100K projects. Paying 3% to acquire a qualified lead is cheaper than Google Ads.
2. Realtor referrals come with built-in trust - your clients already like and trust you.
3. Happy clients refer more clients. Your referral becomes my marketing.

**The only "catch" is:**
- You only get paid on completed projects (not signed contracts)
- Referral must be submitted before the initial consultation
- That's it.

No hidden fees. No clawbacks. No hoops.

Still skeptical? I'm happy to connect you with other agents I work with. Just say the word.

Brandon

### Response: "I already work with a pool company"

Subject: Re: Pool partnership

Hi [First Name],

Totally understand - loyalty to existing partners is a good thing.

Quick question: Are they paying you for referrals?

Most pool companies don't. They're happy to take your referrals but don't compensate you for the business development work.

If your current partner pays you, great - stick with what works.

If not, maybe there's room for a second option? I'm not asking for exclusivity. You could send some referrals to me and some to them, and compare the experience.

Just a thought. Either way, best of luck this season.

Brandon

---

### Response: "Not now, maybe later"

Subject: Re: Pool partnership - staying in touch

Hi [First Name],

Completely understand - timing is everything.

I'll put you on our quarterly newsletter so you see what we're up to (market insights, completed projects, partnership updates). Zero spam, I promise.

When the timing is right, just reply to any email and we'll pick up where we left off.

Wishing you a great season.

Brandon

P.S. - If a client asks about pools in the meantime, feel free to give them my number: 610-870-3113. I'll take good care of them even without a formal partnership.

### Response: "Do you serve [specific area]?"

- Chester County, PA (entire county)
- Delaware County, PA (entire county)
- Montgomery County, PA (Main Line communities)
