# The 10-Minute Script

## Minute 0-1: Opening Hook

---

**[Stand confidently, make eye contact, smile]**

"Good morning/afternoon everyone. Thanks for having me, and thanks [Office Manager Name] for the introduction.

I'll keep this short because I know you have clients to call and deals to close.

**Here's why I'm here:** I want to put money in your pocket. Not eventually. Not maybe. Real money - $1,500 to $3,000 every time you make a simple introduction.

I'm Brandon Calloway. I own Tri-State Aquatic Solutions. We install premium fiberglass pools in Main Line PA, Chester County, and Northern Delaware.

And I'm looking for realtor partners."

---

## Minute 1-3: The Problem and Opportunity

---

**[Transition to relatable scenario]**

"Let me ask you a question by show of hands:

How many of you, in the past year, have had a client ask: 'Do you know anyone who installs pools?'

**[Pause for hands]**

That's what I thought. Most of you.

Now, here's the follow-up question: How many of you had a great answer? A trusted contractor you felt confident recommending?

**[Pause - usually fewer hands]**

And here's the real question: How many of you got paid for that referral?

**[Pause - almost no hands]**

That's the problem I'm solving.

Your clients trust you. They ask you for recommendations on everything - inspectors, contractors, landscapers, and yes, pool installers. You're sending business to people all the time. Most of them don't even say thank you.

**I'm different.** When you send me a client, I pay you. 3% of the total project value. On a $60,000 pool, that's $1,800 in your pocket for making a phone call."

---

## Minute 3-5: Why Partner With Us

---

**[Transition to credibility and differentiation]**

"Now, you might be thinking: 'Okay, but why Tri-State? There are lots of pool companies.'

Fair question. Here's why:

**First - We're local.**
I live here. I work here. I'm not a franchise with crews flying in from out of state. I know Main Line neighborhoods. I know your building codes. I know what your clients expect.

**Second - We're fast.**
We install fiberglass pools. Not concrete. What does that mean for your clients? A pool in 2-4 weeks, not 6 months. If they close on a house in April, they're swimming by Memorial Day.

**Third - We're transparent.**
One quote. No change orders. No 'surprise' costs halfway through. Your clients know exactly what they're paying from day one. That protects your reputation.

**Fourth - We're premium.**
I'm not the cheapest. I'm the best. Lifetime warranty on the pool shell. Pentair and Hayward equipment. Owner on every job site. Your clients will thank you for the recommendation.

**Fifth - We make you look good.**
Every client you send me gets white-glove service. Priority scheduling. Updates throughout the project. When they're hosting pool parties this summer, they'll remember who connected them with us. That's more referrals for you."

---

## Minute 5-7: The Offer

---

**[Transition to specifics]**

"Let me break down exactly what I'm offering:

**The Partnership:**
- You send me a client who wants a pool
- I handle everything - consultation, design, permitting, installation
- You get 3% of the total project value when it's completed
- No caps. No limits. Refer as many clients as you want.

**The Numbers:**

| Pool Size | Typical Price | Your 3% |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Small (12x24) | $45,000 | $1,350 |
| Medium (16x32) | $65,000 | $1,950 |
| Large w/ Spa | $90,000 | $2,700 |

Let's be conservative. You do 30 transactions this year. Maybe 10% of your buyers mention pools. That's 3 referrals. At $60,000 average, that's **$5,400** in your pocket.

For making three introductions.

**[Pause for effect]**

That's real money. And it's money you're currently leaving on the table."

---

## Minute 7-8: How It Works

---

**[Transition to simplicity]**

"You might be thinking: 'This sounds great, but is it complicated?'

Not even a little.

**Here's the entire process:**

**Step 1:** Client asks you about pools, or you're showing a home with pool potential.

**Step 2:** You text me. Or email me. Or call me. You say: 'Hey Brandon, I have a client interested in a pool. Here's their name and number.'

**Step 3:** That's it. You're done.

I call them within 24 hours. I schedule the consultation. I design the pool. I handle permits. I install the pool. I keep you updated along the way.

**Step 4:** When the pool is finished and they're swimming, I mail you a check.

No contracts to sign with me. No exclusive commitments. No complicated tracking systems. You send referrals. I pay you. Simple."

---

## Minute 8-9: Addressing Concerns

---

**[Proactively handle objections]**

"Now, let me address a few things you might be wondering:

**'What if my client doesn't buy?'**
Then you don't owe me anything. Commission is only on completed projects. Zero risk to you.

**'What if I already know a pool guy?'**
Are they paying you? If not, you're doing free marketing for them. I'm offering a better deal.

**'What if my client has a bad experience?'**
That's not going to happen. But if it ever did, I would make it right. My reputation in this community is everything to me. I'm not going to burn a relationship with a realtor partner over one project.

**'Is 3% negotiable?'**
It's not. But it's also already generous. Most pool companies pay nothing. I pay 3% because I know a realtor referral is worth it.

**'Do I have to hit a minimum?'**
No minimums. Send me one referral a year or ten. Whatever you have."

---

## Minute 9-10: Call to Action

---

**[Strong close]**

"Here's my ask:

Take a business card. Take a partnership packet. Look it over.

The next time a client asks about pools - and they will - you'll have an answer. And that answer will put money in your pocket.

**I'm looking for 10 partners in this market.** I'm keeping it limited because I want to give each partner real priority scheduling and attention.

If you want in, grab me after this meeting or email me. My contact info is in the packet.

Any questions?

**[Pause for questions]**

Thank you for your time. I'm excited to work with some of you."

# Q&A Section

## Common Questions and Answers

---

### Q: "What areas do you service exactly?"

**A:** "We cover all of Chester County, all of Delaware County, Main Line communities in Montgomery County, and northern New Castle County in Delaware - that's Hockessin, Wilmington, Greenville, Pike Creek area. If you have a client on the edge of our area, ask me. We can probably make it work for the right project."

---

### Q: "How long does installation really take?"

**A:** "Actual construction is 2-4 weeks for a fiberglass pool. Total timeline including design and permits is typically 8-12 weeks. That's dramatically faster than concrete, which takes 3-6 months. If your client closes in April, they can be swimming by June."

---

### Q: "What's the price range?"

**A:** "Entry level is around $40,000-$45,000 for a smaller pool with basic decking. Most of our projects are in the $55,000-$75,000 range for a mid-size pool with nice features. Luxury projects with spas, water features, and premium decking can be $80,000-$100,000+."

---

### Q: "Do you do financing?"

**A:** "Yes. We partner with Lyon Financial and HFS Financial. Clients can finance up to 30 years, and rates start around 7.5% depending on credit. Most of our clients pay cash, but financing is available for those who want it."

---

### Q: "What about maintenance after the pool is installed?"

**A:** "We offer opening/closing services, weekly maintenance, and equipment repairs. We're not a 'build it and disappear' company. That said, fiberglass pools require about 50% less maintenance than concrete, so your clients will have an easier time of it either way."

---

### Q: "How do I know you're legit?"

**A:** "Great question. I'm fully licensed in Pennsylvania and Delaware. $2 million liability insurance. Workers' comp on all employees. I'm happy to provide proof of insurance for any client who asks. I've also got references from other realtors I work with - happy to connect you if you want to verify."

---

### Q: "What if the backyard is small or has challenges?"

**A:** "We do plunge pools and cocktail pools for smaller spaces. These are 10-14 feet long, perfect for patios and urban lots. They're also more affordable - typically $30,000-$50,000. As for challenges like slopes, rocky soil, or access issues - that's what the site consultation is for. We'll tell clients upfront if something is feasible or not."

---

### Q: "Can I give out your number without officially 'partnering'?"

**A:** "Absolutely. But here's the thing - if you give out my number without submitting the referral first, I can't track that it came from you. To get your commission, I need to know about the referral before the consultation. Just shoot me a quick text: 'Client: John Smith, 555-1234' - that's all it takes."

---

### Q: "What happens if a client I referred ends up not being a good fit?"

**A:** "No problem at all. Some backyards don't work for pools. Some clients aren't ready to move forward. Some change their minds. It happens. You only get paid on completed projects, so there's no awkward situation if a referral doesn't convert."

---

### Q: "How do I get paid? Check? Direct deposit?"

**A:** "Check mailed to you or your brokerage - your choice. We can also do direct deposit if you prefer. Payment goes out within 30 days of project completion. If you want it paid to your brokerage for compliance reasons, just let me know."

---

# Objection Handling Guide

## Deeper Responses for Pushback

---

### Objection: "I don't really deal with pools much."

**Response:**
"I hear you. But think about it - how many buyers have you shown to homes with big backyards? How many have said 'this would be great for a pool someday'? You don't need to specialize in pool homes. You just need to recognize the opportunity when it comes up and have my number ready. One referral a year at $1,800 - that's still real money for almost no effort."

---

### Objection: "My clients are mostly first-time buyers / lower price points."

**Response:**
"That's fair. Pool installations are typically for mid-range to luxury homeowners. But here's something to think about: even if only 5% of your clients are pool candidates, that's still potential income. And as your business grows and you move upmarket, you'll have this partnership already in place. Take a packet anyway - you never know when you'll have that one client who asks."

---

### Objection: "I don't feel comfortable recommending contractors."

**Response:**
"I totally understand the hesitation. Your reputation is on the line with every recommendation you make. That's exactly why I'm here in person - so you can look me in the eye and decide if I'm trustworthy. I'm offering to connect you with other agents I work with so you can verify my track record. And honestly, if you're ever uncertain about a specific client situation, call me first and we'll talk through it."

---

### Objection: "3% seems low for a big referral."

**Response:**
"I hear you. Let me put it in context: most pool companies pay agents 0%. Nothing. They're happy to take your referral and give you a handshake. I'm paying 3% because I value the relationship and I know what a qualified referral is worth to my business. On a $100,000 pool, that's $3,000 for you - for making an introduction. It's designed to be fair for both sides."

---

### Objection: "I need to think about it."

**Response:**
"Absolutely. Take the packet. Read it over. Talk to your broker if you need to. My contact info is inside. When the next client asks about pools - and they will - you'll be ready. No pressure, no deadline. I'm building long-term partnerships here, not trying to close a quick sale."

---

### Objection: "What if my brokerage doesn't allow referral fees?"

**Response:**
"Good question. Most brokerages are fine with vendor referral fees as long as they're disclosed. Some require them to go through the brokerage rather than directly to the agent. Either way works for me - I can issue payment to you or to [Brokerage Name], whatever keeps you compliant. Check with your broker and let me know."
