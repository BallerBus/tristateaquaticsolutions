# Section 1: The Partnership Opportunity

---

## Headline:
## Your Clients Ask About Pools. Now You Can Profit From It.

## Body Copy:

Every year, homebuyers in Main Line PA and Chester County ask their realtors the same question:

*"Do you know anyone who installs pools?"*

Until now, you probably said "I'll ask around" or handed out a random contractor's card.

**That changes today.**

Tri-State Aquatic Solutions is looking for realtor partners who want to:

- **Earn 3% of every pool installation** you refer
- **Look like a hero** with a premium contractor recommendation
- **Provide real value** to clients investing in their homes

No contracts. No commitments. No risk.

Just send us clients who want pools. We'll do the rest. You get paid.

---

# Section 2: How It Works

---

## Headline:
## Three Steps. Passive Income. Happy Clients.

---

### Step 1: Identify the Opportunity
**Your client mentions pools.** Maybe they're buying a home with a big backyard. Maybe they ask about adding a pool after closing. Maybe you're showing a listing that's "perfect for a pool."

---

### Step 2: Make the Introduction
**Text us. Email us. Call us.** Just send the client's name and phone number. That's it. Takes 30 seconds.

---

### Step 3: We Handle Everything
**We contact them within 24 hours.** Free consultation. Custom design. Transparent quote. Permitting. Installation. The whole thing. You're cc'd on key updates so you always know what's happening.

---

### Step 4: Get Paid
**Pool is complete. Client is swimming. Check is in the mail.** 3% of the project value, paid within 30 days of completion.

# Section 4: The Numbers

---

## Headline:
## Let's Do the Math

---

### Your Annual Pool Referral Income

| Your Referrals | Avg Project | Your 3% | Annual Total |
|----------------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| 2 per year | $60,000 | $1,800 | **$3,600** |
| 5 per year | $60,000 | $1,800 | **$9,000** |
| 10 per year | $60,000 | $1,800 | **$18,000** |

---

### Think About It:

You close 30 transactions per year.

10% of your buyers ask about pools = 3 clients.

3 referrals x $1,800 = **$5,400 in passive income.**

For making three phone calls.

## Hear From Agents Already Partnering With Us

---

### Testimonial 1:

> "Brandon and his team are the real deal. I've referred four clients in the past two years, and every single one has sent me a thank-you note. The pools look amazing, the process was smooth, and I earned over $6,000 in referral fees. Win-win-win."
>
> **Mike T. - Long & Foster, Hockessin**

---

### Testimonial 2:

> "As a luxury agent, I'm very careful about who I recommend. Tri-State exceeded my expectations. They treated my client like royalty, finished ahead of schedule, and the pool added significant value to the property. I've made them my exclusive pool partner."
>
> **Jennifer A. - Berkshire Hathaway, Main Line**

---

### Testimonial 3:

>
> **David K. - Coldwell Banker, Chester County**

---

### Testimonial 4:

> "What I appreciate most is the communication. Brandon keeps me in the loop at every stage, so I always know how my client's project is going. That professionalism reflects well on me."
