## Strategy Overview

### Why Remarketing Matters for Pool Installation

Pool installation is a high-consideration purchase with a typical research phase of 3-6 months. Most visitors will not convert on their first visit. Remarketing allows us to:

- **Stay top of mind** during the extended research phase
- **Address objections** through targeted messaging
- **Build trust** through repeated, valuable touchpoints
- **Recover abandoners** who showed high intent but didn't convert
- **Educate prospects** on fiberglass and plunge pool advantages

### The Remarketing Funnel

**Email 2: Helpful Resource**
**Send:** Day 4
**Subject Line Options:**
- A: The one thing most pool buyers forget to ask
- B: This question saves thousands on pool projects

**Body:**
Hi {{FirstName}},

After years of building pools, I've noticed something: the happiest customers aren't the ones who got the lowest price. They're the ones who asked the right questions upfront.

The most important question?

**"What exactly is included in my quote?"**

Sounds simple, but you'd be surprised how often the answer is vague. Change orders, unexpected site prep, equipment "upgrades" that were actually necessary - these can add 20-30% to your final cost.

At Tri-State, we specify everything by brand in your contract. Every material, every piece of equipment, every detail. The price we quote is the price you pay.

If you're comparing pool companies, use this question. The answers will tell you everything.

Brandon

P.S. - Want a quote you can actually rely on? [Schedule a consultation] and I'll show you what transparent pricing looks like.

**Email 3: Social Proof + Soft Ask**
**Send:** Day 8
**Subject Line Options:**
- A: What the Williams family said after 3 weeks
- B: "We wish we'd done this years ago"

**Body:**
Hi {{FirstName}},

I wanted to share a quick story from a recent project.

The Williams family in Hockessin had been thinking about a pool for five years. Five years of "maybe next summer." Five years of watching their kids grow older.

When they finally pulled the trigger, their only regret? Waiting so long.

Three weeks after we started, they were swimming. Here's what they said:

*"Tri-State made what felt impossible feel effortless. Brandon was on-site constantly, we knew what was happening every step of the way, and the final price matched the quote exactly. Our only regret is not doing this five years ago."*

I'm not sharing this to pressure you. I'm sharing it because I've seen too many families spend years thinking about a pool when they could spend those years enjoying one.

Whenever you're ready, I'm here.

**Subject Line Options:**

**Body:**
Hi {{FirstName}},

I'll keep this short.

Is a pool still something you're considering? If so, I'd love to help. If not, no worries at all - just let me know and I'll stop filling your inbox.

If you're still in research mode, here's what a free consultation gives you:
- Walk your backyard with an expert
- Discuss what's realistic for your space
- Get a real quote (not a "starting at" number)
- Learn about financing options
- No obligation whatsoever

One conversation could answer all your questions.

What do you say?

Here's the truth: a consultation is just a conversation. You'll meet me (Brandon, the owner), we'll walk your backyard, and I'll give you honest feedback on what's possible. No pressure, no hard sell.

If you're not ready, that's okay too. I'll still be here when you are.

**Email 2: Addressing Hesitation**
**Send:** Day 2
**Subject Line Options:**
- A: Is something holding you back?
- B: The most common concern (and my answer)

**Body:**
Hi {{FirstName}},

When people start a consultation request and don't finish, it's usually one of three reasons:

**1. "I'm not ready to commit to anything."**
Good news: a consultation isn't a commitment. It's a conversation. You're not signing anything or putting money down. You're just getting information.

**2. "I'm worried about being pressured."**
I get it. The pool industry has a reputation. But I'm a one-man show, not a sales machine. I'll give you information and let you decide on your own timeline.

**3. "I'm not sure I can afford it."**
That's what consultations are for. You might be surprised - or you might not be ready yet. Either way, you'll have real numbers to work with instead of guesses.

Whatever's on your mind, I'm happy to address it. Reply to this email or give me a call.

This is my last email about your consultation request. I don't want to be a pest.

If a pool is still on your radar, the door is open. Reply anytime - even if it's months from now.

Wishing you and your family all the best,

**Body:**
Hi {{FirstName}},

It's been a while since we connected about your pool project. Life moves fast, and priorities shift - I totally understand.

I'm reaching out because spring is approaching, and families who start now will be swimming by summer. If a pool is still in your plans, I wanted to make sure you know the door is open.

**What's new at Tri-State:**

- New plunge pool options starting at $35K
- Even more flexible financing terms

If you'd like to pick up where we left off, I'm here. If not, no hard feelings.

**Email 2: New Angle**
**Send:** Day 8
**Subject Line Options:**
- A: Have you considered a plunge pool?
- B: The pool trend taking Main Line by storm

**Body:**
Hi {{FirstName}},

Since we last spoke, I've noticed a major shift in what homeowners are asking for: plunge pools.

These compact pools (12-14 feet) are perfect for:
- Smaller backyards or tight spaces
- Homeowners who want luxury without extensive maintenance
- Cold plunge wellness routines
- Year-round use with heating
- Faster installation (as quick as 2 weeks)
- Lower investment (starting around $35K)

They're not a compromise - they're a lifestyle choice that's increasingly popular among discerning Main Line families.

If a full-size pool felt like too much, a plunge pool might be the perfect middle ground.

Curious? Let me know and I'll send over some options that might work for your space.

Brandon

**Subject Line Options:**
- A: {{FirstName}}, this is goodbye (for now)
- B: Taking you off my list unless...

**Body:**
Hi {{FirstName}},

I respect your time, so this will be my last email unless I hear from you.

If a pool becomes a priority again - whether that's next month or next year - just reply to any of my emails or call me at 610-870-3113. I'll still be here, building pools for Main Line and Delaware families.

Until then, I wish you a wonderful year ahead.

Warm regards,

Brandon Calloway
Owner, Tri-State Aquatic Solutions

P.S. - If you'd like to stay on our list for occasional updates and seasonal tips, just reply "keep me." Otherwise, I'll assume you'd prefer I step back.
