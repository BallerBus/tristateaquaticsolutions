Hi [First Name],

Congratulations! Your [pool type] pool is officially complete, and we couldn't be more thrilled for you and your family.

From our first meeting to today's final walkthrough, it's been a pleasure working with you. Watching your vision come to life in [neighborhood/town] was exactly why we love what we do.

Now that you've had a chance to enjoy your first swim, we have a quick favor to ask:

Would you take 2 minutes to share your experience on Google?

[BUTTON: Share Your Experience on Google]

Subject: Your pool story could help someone else

Hi [First Name],

I promise this is my last reminder about reviews!

Here's why I'm asking: When we started Tri-State Aquatic Solutions, we were the new guys competing against big national chains. Reviews from families like yours helped other homeowners discover that there's a better, more personal option.

Your story - whether it's about our 2-week installation timeline, how [project manager name] kept you updated, or how much your kids love the tanning ledge - that story helps someone else make a confident decision.

If you have just 2 minutes, here's the link:

[BUTTON: Share Your Story on Google]

And if you're not comfortable leaving a review, no worries at all. We're just grateful we could build your dream pool.

Warm regards,
[Owner Name]
Owner, Tri-State Aquatic Solutions

Hi [First Name],

Thank you if you've already left us a Google review - it truly means so much.

We have one more request: Would you also consider sharing your experience on Houzz?

Houzz is where design-conscious homeowners go for pool and backyard inspiration. Your project - especially the [specific feature: tanning ledge/hardscape/landscaping integration] - is exactly what they're looking for.

[BUTTON: Leave a Houzz Review]
[Direct Houzz Review Link]

Bonus: You can upload photos of your completed pool! Your backyard could inspire someone planning their own transformation.

As a thank you for taking the time, we'd like to offer you:

No pressure - your satisfaction is already the best reward. But if you're willing to help other families find us, we truly appreciate it.

Warmly,

### What NOT to Do

- Do not offer discounts ONLY for positive reviews
- Do not ask customers to mention specific keywords
- Do not write or edit reviews for customers
- Do not offer incentives only to happy customers
- Do not delete requests to unhappy customers (review gating)
- Do not create fake reviews or have employees post reviews
- Do not offer incentives worth more than $50 (appears too transactional)
- Do not pressure or repeatedly ask after multiple declines
