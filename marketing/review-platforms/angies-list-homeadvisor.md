## 1. Platform Overview

### Understanding the Angi Ecosystem

**Background:**
- Angie's List (founded 1995) and HomeAdvisor (founded 1998) merged in 2021
- Combined platform now operates under "Angi"
- Largest home services marketplace in the US
- 150+ million service requests annually

**How It Works:**
1. Homeowners submit project requests
2. Platform matches with service providers
3. Leads distributed to multiple pros (usually 3-4)
4. Pros compete for the job

### Platform Strengths

**Pros:**
- Large user base seeking pool services
- Pre-qualified leads with real intent
- Trust signals (reviews, ratings)
- Geographic targeting
- Brand recognition with homeowners

**Cons:**
- Leads shared with competitors
- Per-lead pricing can be expensive
- Quality varies significantly
- Aggressive upselling by platform
- Less control than organic marketing

### Lead Types

| Lead Type | Description | Typical Cost |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Market Match** | Basic lead, shared with 3-4 pros | $15-$50 |
| **Exact Match** | Closer match to your services | $50-$150 |
| **Screened Leads** | Pre-verified, higher intent | $100-$300 |
| **Exclusive Leads** | Only sent to you | $200-$500+ |

For pool installation (high-ticket):
- Expect $150-$400+ per qualified lead
- Exclusive leads can exceed $500
