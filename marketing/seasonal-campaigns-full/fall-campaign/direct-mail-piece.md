**Headline:**
```
The Smart Way to Buy a Pool
```

**Body:**
```
Dear Neighbor,

Here's a secret most pool companies won't share:

The best time to buy a pool isn't spring. It's right now.

Fall buyers save $7,500-$10,000 compared to spring. They get our full attention for design. And they're first in the pool next spring.

Why? Simple economics. Our slower season means we can offer discounts we'd never consider in spring.

Smart homeowners take advantage.
