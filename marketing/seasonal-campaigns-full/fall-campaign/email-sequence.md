Hi [First Name],

Let me share something most pool companies won't tell you:

The best time to buy a pool isn't spring. It's right now.

Here's why fall is your secret weapon:

1. MAXIMUM SAVINGS
Our off-season pricing offers $7,500-$10,000 off installation - the biggest discount we offer all year. That's not a typo.

2. PERSONALIZED ATTENTION
Our design team isn't slammed with projects right now. You get our full attention and expertise.

3. SKIP THE SPRING RUSH
Every spring, families compete for limited installation slots. Many are disappointed. But fall planners? They get priority scheduling.

4. NO PRESSURE
Design thoughtfully over the coming months. No rushing. No compromises. Get it perfect.

5. PRICE PROTECTION
Lock in 2026 pricing now, regardless of 2027 cost increases.

OFF-SEASON ADVANTAGE PACKAGE:
- $7,500-$10,000 off installation
- Free 3D design package ($500 value)
- Free permit filing ($1,200 value)
- Priority spring installation slot

This offer is available September through November only.

Hi [First Name],

What if you could design your dream pool without feeling rushed?

That's exactly what fall planning offers.

During spring, our design team is managing multiple consultations, juggling installation schedules, and working against tight deadlines. Everything moves fast - sometimes too fast.

But right now? We have time for you.

WHAT "DESIGN WITHOUT RUSH" LOOKS LIKE:

Extended Consultations
Our spring meetings are 60 minutes. Fall consultations can run 90 minutes or more. We're not watching the clock.

Multiple 3D Revisions
Spring clients typically get 2-3 design revisions before we need to move forward. Fall clients? As many as it takes until you're thrilled.

Feature Exploration
Have you considered a tanning ledge? An integrated spa? Smart pool automation? In fall, we have time to walk you through every option.

Spouse/Partner Flexibility
Need to schedule around two busy calendars? Fall has the flexibility. Spring rarely does.

THE FALL PLANNING TIMELINE:

September-October: In-depth consultation, site assessment, initial designs
November: Design refinements, feature selections, finalize plans
December: Lock in pricing, schedule spring installation
April 2027: Your pool is installed while others are still waiting for consultations

This is how premium pools get built - with thought, care, and no rushing.

Hi [First Name],

I want to show you exactly what our Off-Season Advantage looks like in real numbers.

STANDARD SPRING INSTALLATION:
Base pool installation: $65,000
3D Design package: $500
Permit filing: $1,200
Winter cover: $800
-----------------------------
SPRING TOTAL: $67,500

OFF-SEASON ADVANTAGE (Now through November):
Base pool installation: $65,000
Off-season discount: -$7,500
3D Design package: FREE
Permit filing: FREE
Winter cover: FREE
-----------------------------
YOUR TOTAL: $55,000

YOUR SAVINGS: $12,500

That's enough for:
- Premium LED lighting upgrade AND
- Automatic safety cover AND
- Pool heater upgrade AND
- Still money left over

OR just $12,500 back in your pocket.

Same pool. Same quality. Same installation timeline. Just smarter timing.

This isn't a gimmick. It's simple economics: our slower season means we can pass savings to customers who plan ahead.

Hi [First Name],

I want to share a story about the Williams family from Gladwyne.

Last October, they called us about a pool. They'd been thinking about it for years but always got distracted by spring's chaos - quotes from multiple companies, trying to squeeze into packed schedules, feeling rushed into decisions.

This time, they tried a different approach.

THEIR FALL PLANNING EXPERIENCE:

October: "We had a 2-hour consultation at our home. No rush. Bryce walked us through every option, answered all our questions, and actually listened to what we wanted."

November: "We went through three design revisions until it was exactly right. In spring, we would have felt pressured to approve faster."

December: "We locked in our price and scheduled installation for April. Then we relaxed through the holidays knowing it was handled."

April: "While our neighbors were still scheduling consultations, we were already swimming."

THE RESULT:

- Saved $8,500 vs. spring pricing
- Got exactly the pool they wanted (no rushed compromises)
- First on the street in the pool that spring
- Zero stress throughout the process

"Looking back, I can't believe more people don't do this," Jennifer Williams told me. "It just makes so much sense."

Want the same experience?

Hi [First Name],

This is your three-week warning.

November 30 is in 20 days.

After that:
- Off-season pricing ($7,500-$10,000 discount) ends
- Free design package ends
- Free permit filing ends
- 2027 pricing takes effect (higher than 2026)

I know this is a big decision. A pool is a significant investment.

But I also know that every year, people tell me they wish they'd done this sooner. They wish they hadn't waited through another summer watching others enjoy their pools.

HERE'S WHAT I CAN OFFER:

If you're on the fence, schedule a no-obligation consultation this week. We'll:
- Assess your property
- Discuss your vision
- Show you a 3D preview of your pool
- Give you a detailed, transparent proposal

You'll have all the information you need to make a decision - with no pressure.

If it feels right, lock in the savings.
If it doesn't, no hard feelings. We'll be here when you're ready.

But the off-season pricing? That ends November 30. No exceptions.

Hi [First Name],

This is my final message about 2026 off-season pricing.

NOVEMBER 30 IS IN 4 DAYS.

After that:
- Off-season discount: GONE
- Free 3D design: GONE
- Free permit filing: GONE
- 2026 pricing: GONE
- Spring priority slots: LIMITED

Here's the bottom line:

If you want a pool in 2027, you have two choices:

CHOICE A: Lock in now
- Save $7,500-$10,000
- Get free design package
- Get free permit filing
- Secure spring priority
- Pay 2026 prices

CHOICE B: Wait for spring
- Pay full price
- Compete for limited slots
- Rush through design
- Pay 2027 prices (higher)
- Maybe swim by June... maybe later

The choice seems obvious to me. But it's your decision.

If you want Choice A, you need to move in the next 4 days.

And if a pool is in your future - whenever that is - we'll be here.
