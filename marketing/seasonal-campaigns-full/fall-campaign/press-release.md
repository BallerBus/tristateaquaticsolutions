# Local Pool Builder Offers Largest Discounts of the Year During Off-Season Window

*Tri-State Aquatic Solutions announces $7,500-$10,000 off installations through November, encouraging homeowners to "plan now for spring swimming"*

---

**HOCKESSIN, DE (September 1, 2026)** - Tri-State Aquatic Solutions, a leading fiberglass pool installer serving the Main Line of Philadelphia and Northern Delaware, today announced its annual off-season pricing program, offering homeowners $7,500 to $10,000 off pool installations booked through November 30.

The promotion, which the company calls the "Off-Season Advantage," is designed to reward homeowners who plan ahead during the traditionally slower fall months.

"Every spring, we turn away families who waited too long," said Bryce Dude, owner of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions. "By offering significant discounts in fall, we fill our spring calendar early and customers save thousands. Everyone wins."

## Off-Season Advantage Details

The Off-Season Advantage package includes:
- $7,500 off standard pool installations
- $10,000 off premium packages
- Free 3D design package ($500 value)
- Free permit filing ($1,200 value)
- Free winter cover with spring installation
- Priority spring 2027 scheduling
- 2026 price protection

According to Dude, the total potential savings approaches $12,500 for customers who book during the off-season window.

## Why Fall Planning Works

Industry data suggests that pool installations booked in fall benefit from several advantages beyond pricing:

**More Thoughtful Design Process**
Without the pressure of a packed spring calendar, customers have more time for consultations, design revisions, and decision-making.

**Guaranteed Spring Scheduling**
Fall buyers secure priority placement for spring installation, avoiding the rush when demand peaks.

**Price Protection**
With material and labor costs continuing to rise, locking in 2026 pricing protects against 2027 increases.

"The customers who plan in fall are typically the most satisfied," Dude noted. "They've had time to think through every detail without feeling rushed. When spring arrives, they're ready - and they're first in line."

## Limited Availability

Tri-State Aquatic Solutions limits spring installations to ensure quality and attention for each project. The company reports that only 15 priority spring slots are available through the off-season program.

"Once those slots are filled, customers who wait for spring will be competing for whatever dates remain," Dude explained. "And they'll pay full price."

The off-season pricing deadline is November 30, 2026, with no extensions.

## Pool Closing Services Also Available

For existing pool owners, Tri-State Aquatic Solutions is now offering professional winterization services. The company notes that proper closing is essential for protecting pool investment and ensuring smooth spring openings.
