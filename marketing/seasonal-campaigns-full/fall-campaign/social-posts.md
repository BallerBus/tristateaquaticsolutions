FALL PLANNER SUCCESS STORY:

The Nguyens called us last October. They'd been thinking about a pool for 5 years.

"We always got overwhelmed by the spring rush," Amy told us. "Everyone wanted us to decide quickly. It never felt right."

Their fall experience was different:
- 2-hour consultation (no rushing)
- 4 design revisions until perfect
- Locked in before Thanksgiving
- Swimming by April

Their advice? "Do it in fall. It's so much less stressful."

Your turn?
