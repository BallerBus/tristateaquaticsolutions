# Labor Day Promotion
## End of Summer Sale Campaign

**Campaign Period:** Friday, August 28 - Monday, September 1, 2026 (Labor Day Weekend)
**Campaign Theme:** "End of Summer Sale"
**Primary Goal:** Drive fall installation bookings and capture last-minute summer demand
**Format:** 4-day promotional event

---

## Executive Summary

Labor Day marks the unofficial end of summer. This creates a natural inflection point where homeowners realize another summer is ending without their dream pool. The campaign capitalizes on this emotional moment while positioning fall installation as the smart alternative.

---

## Campaign Strategy

### Core Positioning
This is the end of summer - but NOT the end of your pool opportunity. Fall installation means you'll be first in the pool next year, and you'll save money doing it.

### Dual Messaging
1. **Summer regret angle:** "Another summer without a pool?"
2. **Fall opportunity angle:** "Fall installation = spring swimming at a discount"

### Key Elements
- Summer reflection emotional trigger
- Fall booking incentive
- Limited-time urgency
- End-of-year planning motivation

---
