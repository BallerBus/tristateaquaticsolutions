# Spring Campaign: "Spring Installation Blitz"
## Complete Campaign Overview

**Campaign Period:** March 1 - May 31, 2026
**Campaign Theme:** "Your Summer Is Waiting"
**Primary Goal:** Fill spring installation calendar and maximize Memorial Day completions
**Secondary Goal:** Build waitlist for summer/fall installations

---

## Executive Summary

The Spring Installation Blitz is our highest-urgency campaign of the year. Every piece of content drives toward one goal: getting prospects to commit NOW before spring slots fill and Memorial Day becomes impossible.

This campaign capitalizes on:
- Warming weather triggering pool desire
- Natural urgency of limited installation windows
- FOMO from neighbors already installing pools
- Memorial Day as a powerful deadline

---

## Campaign Strategy

### Core Positioning
We position Tri-State as the solution for homeowners who want to be swimming THIS summer, not next year. The message is clear: the window is closing, but there's still time IF you act now.

### Key Differentiators to Emphasize
1. **2-4 week installation** (vs. 4-6 months for concrete)
2. **Limited spring slots** (scarcity/urgency)
3. **Memorial Day completion guarantee** (conditional on booking date)
4. **Local expertise** (we know Main Line neighborhoods)
5. **Fiberglass advantage** (faster, lower maintenance)

### Emotional Drivers
- **Fear:** Missing another summer without a pool
- **Excitement:** Finally making it happen
- **Pride:** Being the house everyone wants to visit
- **Relief:** Working with professionals who handle everything
