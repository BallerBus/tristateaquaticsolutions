Hi [First Name],

Spring has officially arrived in the Main Line, and with it comes the most important question:

Will you be swimming in YOUR backyard this summer?

Right now, our spring calendar is open - but it won't be for long. Every year, we reach capacity by mid-April, and families who waited too long have to postpone their dreams until fall.

This year, don't be one of them.

SPRING INSTALLATION BLITZ SPECIAL:

- Free LED pool lighting upgrade ($1,200 value)
- Priority scheduling for Memorial Day completion
- Locked-in pricing through project completion

We still have availability for spring installations - but our schedule fills fast once the weather breaks.

P.S. We can typically provide a consultation within 3-5 days right now. That window shrinks quickly as spring progresses.

Hi [First Name],

Last March, the Chen family of West Chester was debating whether to move forward with their pool project.

"We almost talked ourselves into waiting another year," Jennifer Chen told us. "Thank goodness we didn't."

By June 15, their entire family was enjoying their new fiberglass pool. The kids spent the entire summer in the backyard instead of begging to go to the community pool.

"Our only regret? Not doing it sooner."

THE SECRET TO THEIR SUCCESS:

They didn't wait until it was "perfect." They called us in early March, scheduled a consultation, and made a decision.

WHERE WE STAND RIGHT NOW:

- Spring installation slots: 6 remaining
- Current lead time: 3-4 weeks from contract to completion
- After April 15: Lead time extends to 6-8 weeks

The math is simple:

Act now = Swimming by Memorial Day
Wait = Maybe swimming by July 4th
Wait too long = Swimming next year

[BUTTON: SCHEDULE YOUR CONSULTATION]

Here's to making smart decisions,

Bryce Dude
Owner, Tri-State Aquatic Solutions

P.S. Our March promotion includes free LED lighting upgrade ($1,200 value) with every installation. This offer ends March 31.

Hi [First Name],

I'm going to be direct with you: if you want to be swimming in your backyard by Memorial Day, you need to make a decision within the next three weeks.

Here's the reality of our spring calendar:

TIMELINE BREAKDOWN:

Projects signed by April 1-15:
-> Completed by Memorial Day

Projects signed April 16-30:
-> May complete by early-mid June

Projects signed May 1+:
-> July completion realistic

I'm not trying to pressure you. I'm giving you an honest timeline so you can make the best decision for your family.

WHAT YOU CAN STILL GET:

- Memorial Day completion (if signed by April 15)
- Free LED lighting upgrade ($1,200 value)
- Locked-in spring pricing
- Priority scheduling

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU WAIT:

- Installation pushed to summer months
- Lose weeks/months of summer enjoyment
- Potentially higher pricing as demand peaks

Your call. But if swimming by Memorial Day matters to you, the time to act is now.

[BUTTON: YES, I WANT TO SWIM BY MEMORIAL DAY]

Let's make this summer count,

Bryce Dude
Owner, Tri-State Aquatic Solutions

P.S. Reply "TIMELINE" and I'll personally call you to discuss your specific situation.

Hi [First Name],

When we survey our clients about their favorite pool features, one upgrade wins every single time:

LED pool lighting.

Here's why it transforms the entire experience:

EXTENDED EVENING ENJOYMENT
Your pool doesn't have to close at sunset. Some of the best pool moments happen after dark - kids playing, adults relaxing, stars overhead.

AMBIANCE AND MOOD
Color-changing options let you set the perfect atmosphere for any occasion. Calm blue for relaxation. Party mode for entertaining. Romantic purple for date nights.

SAFETY
See clearly when swimming at night. Know when someone's in the pool. Peace of mind for parents and homeowners alike.

HOME VALUE
Premium LED lighting is a feature that impresses potential buyers. It signals quality and attention to detail throughout the installation.

Normally, upgraded LED lighting adds $1,200 to your project.

But through April 30, it's included FREE with every spring installation.

This isn't a "sale" gimmick. It's our way of thanking families who commit during our busy season - and ensuring every pool we install looks stunning day and night.

Still have spring slots available (barely). Let's make this happen.

P.S. After April 30, lighting upgrades return to regular pricing. Just wanted you to know.

## Email 5: Final Spring Push

### Subject Line Options (A/B Test)
- A: "Last call: 3 spring installation slots remaining"
- B: "[First Name], we're almost full for spring"
- C: "After Friday, no more spring installations"

### Preview Text
"Earliest available start date: May 12. Projected completion: Early-mid June."

### Send Date

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to give you one final update on our spring availability:

CURRENT STATUS:
- Spring installation slots remaining: 3
- Earliest available start date: May 12
- Projected completion: Early-mid June

After these 3 slots are filled, our next available installation window is July.

I know that's not what you want to hear if you were hoping to swim this summer. But I'd rather be honest with you now than make promises we can't keep.

IF YOU'RE STILL INTERESTED IN A SUMMER INSTALLATION:

Option A: Grab one of our final 3 spring slots
-> Installations begin May 12
-> Completion by mid-June

Option B: Book a summer installation now
-> Start in July
-> Swimming by late July/early August

Option C: Wait until fall
-> We'll design your pool this summer
-> Install when the fall calendar opens

Any of these work. But waiting indefinitely means waiting until next year.

What's your preference? Reply to this email or call me directly.

Hi [First Name],

This is it.

Our spring installation calendar closes this Friday. After that, any new projects will be scheduled for July at the earliest.

Here's where we stand right now:

SPRING SLOTS: 1 remaining
NEXT AVAILABLE START: May 15
PROJECTED COMPLETION: June 1

If you've been thinking about a pool - if you've been waiting for the "right time" - this is quite literally your last chance to swim this spring.

I'm not saying this to pressure you. I'm saying it because I've seen too many families wait until it's too late, then spend another summer looking over the fence at their neighbor's pool.

WHAT YOU GET IF YOU ACT THIS WEEK:

- One of our final spring slots
- Installation beginning mid-May
- Swimming by early June
- Free LED lighting upgrade ($1,200 value)
- Locked-in spring pricing

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU WAIT:

- Next installation window: July
- Swimming: Late July/August
- Spring pricing ends (costs increase)
- Summer = peak demand (less flexibility)

One phone call can change your entire summer.
