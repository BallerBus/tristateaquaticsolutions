## SECTION 8: FAQ

### Section Headline
## Frequently Asked Questions

### Accordion FAQ Items

**Q: How much does a fiberglass pool cost?**
A: Our fiberglass pool installations typically range from $45,000 to $85,000 depending on pool size, features, and site conditions. We provide detailed, transparent proposals with no hidden fees after your free consultation. Every quote includes installation, equipment, basic decking, and everything needed to swim.

**Q: Can I really be swimming by Memorial Day?**
A: Yes, if you book by April 15. Our fiberglass pools install in 2-4 weeks once permits are approved. We've helped dozens of families hit their Memorial Day deadline. After April 15, we can still complete most projects by mid-June.

**Q: What's included in the Spring Blitz Special?**
A: The Spring Blitz Special includes free LED pool lighting ($1,200 value), a free pool cover consultation ($400 value), priority scheduling for Memorial Day completion, and locked-in pricing protection. Total value: over $1,600.

**Q: Do you handle permits?**
A: Absolutely. We handle all permits and inspections as part of our service. In most Main Line communities, permits are approved within 1-2 weeks. We're familiar with local requirements in PA and DE.

**Q: How long does the installation take?**
A: The actual installation typically takes 2-3 weeks from the day we break ground. This includes excavation, pool placement, plumbing, electrical, backfill, decking, and final touches. Total time from signed contract to swimming is typically 6-8 weeks.

**Q: What areas do you serve?**
A: We serve the Main Line of Philadelphia, Chester County, Delaware County, and Northern Delaware including Hockessin, Wilmington, and surrounding areas.

**Q: Is fiberglass really better than concrete?**
A: For most residential applications, yes. Fiberglass offers faster installation (weeks vs. months), 50% lower lifetime maintenance, a smoother surface that never needs resurfacing, and lower chemical and heating costs. Concrete is best for extremely custom shapes or estate-scale projects.
