# Tri-State Aquatic Solutions Launches "Spring Installation Blitz" as Pool Demand Surges Across Main Line Philadelphia

*Local pool installer offers expedited installations and premium upgrades to meet unprecedented spring demand*

---

**HOCKESSIN, DE (March 1, 2026)** - Tri-State Aquatic Solutions, a leading fiberglass pool installer serving the Main Line of Philadelphia, Chester County, and Northern Delaware, today announced the launch of its "Spring Installation Blitz" campaign, offering homeowners the opportunity to have a pool installed and ready for Memorial Day swimming.

The campaign comes as demand for residential pools continues to surge in the region. According to industry data, pool installations in suburban Philadelphia have increased by over 40% since 2020, with wait times at some contractors extending to 6-8 months.

"We're seeing unprecedented interest from Main Line families who want to create backyard retreats," said Bryce Dude, owner of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions. "The difference is that our fiberglass pools can be installed in just 2-4 weeks, not 4-6 months like traditional concrete pools. That means families who act now can still be swimming this summer."

## Spring Installation Blitz Offers

As part of the Spring Installation Blitz, Tri-State Aquatic Solutions is offering:

- **Free LED Pool Lighting Upgrade** ($1,200 value) - Color-changing, energy-efficient lighting included with every spring installation
- **Priority Memorial Day Scheduling** - Guaranteed completion by Memorial Day weekend for contracts signed by April 15
- **Free Pool Cover Consultation** ($400 value) - Expert guidance on automatic and safety cover options
- **Locked-In Pricing** - Protection against material cost increases through project completion

## Why Fiberglass?

Tri-State Aquatic Solutions specializes in fiberglass pool installations, which offer several advantages over traditional concrete pools:

- **Faster Installation:** 2-4 weeks vs. 4-6 months for concrete
- **Lower Maintenance:** 50% less maintenance over the pool's lifetime
- **Smoother Surface:** Non-porous gel-coat finish never needs resurfacing
- **Better Efficiency:** Lower chemical usage and heating costs
- **Lifetime Warranty:** Structural warranty included

"Fiberglass technology has advanced dramatically in recent years," Dude explained. "Today's fiberglass pools offer the same luxury features as concrete - tanning ledges, built-in seating, custom lighting - but with faster installation and significantly lower lifetime costs. It's become the smart choice for discerning homeowners."

## Limited Availability

The company emphasizes that spring installation slots are limited. Last year, Tri-State Aquatic Solutions reached capacity by mid-April, forcing many interested homeowners to wait until fall for installation.

"We only take on projects we can complete with the attention and quality our customers deserve," said Dude. "That means our spring calendar fills up quickly. Homeowners who are serious about swimming this summer should schedule their consultation now rather than later."
