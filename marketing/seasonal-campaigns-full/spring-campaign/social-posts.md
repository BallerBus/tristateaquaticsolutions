"How long does a fiberglass pool installation REALLY take?"

Here's the honest answer from 15+ years of installations:

- Excavation: 1-2 days
- Shell placement: 1 day
- Plumbing/electrical: 3-5 days
- Decking/finishing: 5-7 days
- Final touches: 2-3 days

TOTAL: 2-3 weeks of actual work

Compare that to concrete pools: 4-6 MONTHS

This is why fiberglass is the smart choice for homeowners who value their time.

3. Be ready to swim the moment it warms up
4. Landscaping establishes over winter

We're now accepting fall installation bookings (September-November).
