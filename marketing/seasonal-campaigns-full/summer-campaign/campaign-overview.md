# Summer Campaign: "Still Time This Season"
## Complete Campaign Overview

**Campaign Period:** June 1 - August 31, 2026
**Campaign Theme:** "Still Time This Season + Beat the Rush for Next Year"
**Primary Goal:** Fill summer installation slots and capture fall bookings
**Secondary Goal:** Drive referrals from recent installations and maintenance revenue

---

## Executive Summary

The Summer Campaign serves two critical purposes:

1. **Capture late-season demand:** Homeowners watching others enjoy pools this summer, realizing they want one too
2. **Build fall pipeline:** Smart homeowners booking now to beat next spring's rush

This campaign acknowledges that while Memorial Day has passed, there's still plenty of summer left to enjoy - AND positions fall installation as the truly smart move.

## Campaign Strategy

### Dual Messaging Track

**Track 1: "Still Time This Summer" (June-July)**
- Target: Homeowners who want to swim THIS year
- Message: "Summer isn't over - you can still be swimming in 6-8 weeks"
- Urgency: Limited summer slots, before fall schedule fills

**Track 2: "Beat Next Year's Rush" (July-August)**
- Target: Planners who want to do it right
- Message: "Book fall installation, skip the 2027 spring rush"
- Value: Off-season pricing, best timing, early spring swimming

### Emotional Drivers
- **Envy:** Seeing neighbors/friends enjoying their pools
- **Regret:** Wishing they'd started earlier
- **Smart planning:** Getting ahead while others wait
- **Relief:** Taking action instead of waiting another year
