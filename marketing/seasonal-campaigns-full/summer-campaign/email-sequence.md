Hi [First Name],

I'll be honest with you: this email is for people who are a little jealous this summer.

Jealous of the neighbors with the pool. Jealous of friends who host pool parties. Jealous of anyone who can escape the heat in their own backyard.

Here's the good news: it's NOT too late.

There's still 12+ weeks of pool weather ahead. That means if you act now, you could be swimming in your own backyard by mid-July.

SUMMER INSTALLATION SPECIAL:
- $2,000 off installation
- Free pool startup kit ($400 value)
- Expedited scheduling
- Extended equipment warranty

Our summer calendar is open - for now. Once it fills, the next available window is fall.

This could be the summer everything changes.

P.S. Not ready for summer? Our fall installation slots are now open with $3,000 off. Either way, next summer could look very different.

Hi [First Name],

It's June 15th. The Main Line is officially in pool season.

Right now, somewhere in your neighborhood, a family is splashing in their backyard pool.

The kids are laughing. The grill is going. Someone just did a cannonball.

And maybe... you're watching from across the fence. Wishing that was your backyard.

I get it. I've heard the same story from dozens of families:

"We always meant to get a pool..."
"We just never got around to it..."
"Another summer slipped by..."

Here's the thing: that doesn't have to be your story anymore.

WHAT 6-8 WEEKS FROM NOW COULD LOOK LIKE:

Week 1-2: Consultation and design
Week 3-4: Permits and preparation
Week 5-7: Installation
Week 8: YOU'RE SWIMMING

The math is simple: Act now = pool party by late July.

[BUTTON: START YOUR TRANSFORMATION]

Or keep watching from the fence. Your choice.

Bryce Dude
Owner, Tri-State Aquatic Solutions

P.S. Can't do this summer? No problem. Book your fall installation now ($3,000 off) and be first in the pool next spring.

Hi [First Name],

If you have a pool, you know the question that comes up at every summer gathering:

"Who built your pool?"

Your friends see your backyard. They see how happy your family is. They start dreaming about their own pool.

Here's the thing: every time you answer that question, you could be earning $1,000.

SUMMER REFERRAL BONUS (DOUBLED):
- You receive: $1,000 per referred installation
- They receive: $500 off their project
- Unlimited referrals: No cap on earnings

Normal referral bonus: $500
Summer bonus: $1,000

One successful referral? $1,000 in your pocket.
Three referrals? $3,000.
Five referrals? $5,000.

HOW IT WORKS:

1. Send us your friend's name and contact info
2. We reach out and mention you
3. If they install a pool, you get paid within 30 days

That's it. No paperwork. No hassle. Just money for sharing your experience.

[BUTTON: REFER A FRIEND NOW]

This doubled bonus is only available through August 31.

Thanks for being a valued part of the Tri-State family,

Bryce Dude
Owner, Tri-State Aquatic Solutions

P.S. The easiest $1,000 you'll ever make. Just reply with their name and phone number, and we'll take it from there.

Hi [First Name],

Summer is in full swing. And if you haven't pulled the trigger on a pool yet, I want to share something most pool companies won't tell you:

FALL IS ACTUALLY THE BEST TIME TO INSTALL A POOL.

Here's why smart homeowners are booking fall installations right now:

1. BETTER PRICING
Our fall installations include $3,000 off plus a free winter cover ($800 value). That's nearly $4,000 in savings.

2. SKIP THE SPRING RUSH
Every spring, we're flooded with calls from homeowners who all want to swim by Memorial Day. Many get disappointed when we're already booked.

Fall installers? They get spring priority. First in the pool while others are still waiting for consultations.

3. PERFECT TIMING
Install in September-November. Pool "sleeps" over winter. Opens in April. You're swimming while everyone else is still shopping.

4. THOUGHTFUL PLANNING
No rush. Design your pool this summer with our full attention. Make revisions. Get it perfect.

FALL PLANNING ADVANTAGE:
- $3,000 off installation
- Free winter cover ($800 value)
- Priority spring opening
- Lock in 2026 pricing (before 2027 increases)

Spots are limited - we only do 15 fall installations max.

[BUTTON: EXPLORE FALL INSTALLATION]

Here's to smart planning,

Bryce Dude
Owner, Tri-State Aquatic Solutions

P.S. Still want to swim THIS summer? We have a few summer slots left. But they won't last long.

## Email 5: Mid-Summer Decision

### Subject Line Options (A/B Test)
- A: "July is half over. Have you decided?"
- B: "[First Name], it's decision time"
- C: "The pool you've been dreaming about..."

### Preview Text

Hi [First Name],

July is almost over. August is around the corner.

If you've been thinking about a pool, you're at a decision point.

Let me lay out your options clearly:

OPTION A: SUMMER INSTALLATION
- Still possible if you act THIS WEEK
- Completion: Mid-Late August
- Offer: $2,000 off + expedited scheduling
- Deadline: Sign by July 31 for summer completion

OPTION B: FALL INSTALLATION
- Book now for September-November install
- Completion: Before winter
- Offer: $3,000 off + free winter cover
- Deadline: August 31 for fall scheduling

OPTION C: WAIT
- Next installation window: Spring 2027
- Compete with the rush
- No special pricing
- Another summer of watching

I'm not trying to pressure you. I'm trying to help you see the choice clearly.

If you want a pool:
- Summer is still possible (barely)
- Fall is the smart move
- Waiting means another year

If you don't want a pool:
- No hard feelings
- Reply "REMOVE" and I'll stop emailing

But if you DO want one... what are you waiting for?

Hi [First Name],

This is my final message about 2026 pool installation.

Here's where we stand:

SUMMER INSTALLATIONS: CLOSED
Our summer calendar is full. No more summer completions available.

FALL INSTALLATIONS: DEADLINE AUGUST 31
We have 4 fall slots remaining. After August 31, our next availability is spring 2027.

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU MISS AUGUST 31:
- No 2026 installation
- Compete with 2027 spring rush
- No fall pricing discount
- Wait 6-8 months minimum

WHAT YOU GET IF YOU ACT NOW:
- $3,000 off installation
- Free winter cover ($800 value)
- September-November installation
- Swimming next April while others wait

4 slots. 16 days. That's the math.

[BUTTON: CLAIM YOUR FALL SLOT]

I've seen this same story play out for years:

Families think about it all summer. They never quite pull the trigger. Then suddenly it's September, and they're kicking themselves.

"We meant to call..."
"We should have done it..."
"Maybe next year..."

And then next year comes, and the cycle repeats.

This email is your pattern interrupt.

If you want a pool - really want one - this is the moment to act.

One phone call: (302) 555-0123
One click: [Schedule Consultation]

Either one changes everything.

Bryce Dude
Owner, Tri-State Aquatic Solutions

P.S. Not ready this year? Reply "2027" and I'll add you to our winter planning list. You'll be first to know when off-season specials open in October.
