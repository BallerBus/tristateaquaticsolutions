# Local Pool Installer Reports Record Summer Demand, Opens Fall Installation Booking with Off-Season Savings

*Tri-State Aquatic Solutions sees 40% increase in summer inquiries; offers fall booking incentives as homeowners plan ahead*

---

**HOCKESSIN, DE (June 15, 2026)** - Tri-State Aquatic Solutions, a leading fiberglass pool installer serving the Main Line of Philadelphia, Chester County, and Northern Delaware, announced today that summer demand for residential pool installations has reached record levels, with inquiries up 40% compared to the same period last year.

In response to the surge in demand and to help homeowners plan strategically, the company has opened its fall installation booking window with significant off-season savings, including $3,000 off installation costs and a complimentary winter cover valued at $800.

"We're seeing an incredible number of families who are finally ready to make the investment in their backyard," said Bryce Dude, owner of Tri-State Aquatic Solutions. "Some want to swim this summer and we're working to accommodate them. Others are thinking ahead and booking fall installations to save money and skip next spring's rush."

## Summer Installations Still Available

Despite the high demand, Tri-State Aquatic Solutions reports that a limited number of summer installation slots remain available. The company's fiberglass pool technology allows for 2-4 week installations, meaning homeowners who act quickly can still be swimming before Labor Day.

"The advantage of fiberglass is speed," explained Dude. "While concrete pool customers are often told to wait until next year, our process means we can still deliver pools this summer. But the window is closing fast."

Summer installation specials include:
- $2,000 off installation costs
- Free pool startup kit ($400 value)
- Expedited scheduling priority
- Extended equipment warranty

## Fall Booking: The Smart Money Move

For homeowners who prefer a more strategic approach, fall installation offers significant advantages. According to Dude, fall buyers typically save more money and face less competition for scheduling.

"There's a secret in the pool industry," Dude shared. "Fall is actually the best time to install. Prices are lower because demand is lower. Scheduling is easier. And fall buyers are first in the pool when spring arrives, while everyone else is still waiting for consultations."

Fall installation advantages include:
- $3,000 off installation (largest discount outside of winter)
- Free winter cover ($800 value)
- Customer's choice of installation dates
- Priority spring opening service
- Price protection against 2027 increases

The fall booking deadline is August 31, 2026, with only 15 installation slots available.

## Referral Program Doubles Summer Bonus

Tri-State Aquatic Solutions also announced a doubled referral bonus for the summer season. Existing customers who refer friends or neighbors will receive $1,000 per successful installation referral, up from the standard $500 bonus. The referred customer also receives a $500 credit toward their project.

"Our customers are our best marketing," said Dude. "When someone loves their pool, they naturally share that with friends and neighbors. We want to reward that loyalty."

## About Fiberglass Pool Technology

Fiberglass pools have seen significant growth in popularity in recent years, with the category now representing approximately 20% of all in-ground pool installations nationally. Key advantages include:

- Installation time of 2-4 weeks (vs. 4-6 months for concrete)
