## Campaign Strategy

### Core Positioning
Winter is for dreaming and planning. While the backyard is dormant, imagination flourishes. We help homeowners turn winter dreams into spring reality - at the best prices of the new year.

### Key Differentiators
1. **Winter pricing** ($5,000-$7,500 off before spring increase)
2. **Design focus** (unrushed, detailed, personalized)
3. **First-to-swim guarantee** (priority spring scheduling)
4. **Price lock** (2026/early 2027 rates protected)
5. **Holiday/New Year motivation** (resolution, fresh start)

### Emotional Drivers
- **Aspiration:** Dreaming of summer, warmth, family time
- **Planning:** Starting the new year with purpose
- **Smart timing:** Getting ahead before prices rise
- **Excitement:** Turning long-held dreams into action
