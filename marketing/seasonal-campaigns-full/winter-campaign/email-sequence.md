Hi [First Name],

Right now, it's cold outside. The backyard is quiet. The grill is covered. Summer feels far away.

But somewhere in your mind, there's a picture. A vision.

You're floating in crystal-clear water. The kids are splashing nearby. The sun is warm on your face. This isn't a public pool or a friend's backyard - it's yours.

Winter is the perfect time to dream about that picture. And to start making it real.

WHY WINTER IS IDEAL FOR POOL PLANNING:

1. You have time to think, explore, and decide without pressure
2. Our design team has full availability for extended consultations
3. Winter pricing saves you $5,000-$7,500 before spring increases
4. You'll be first in line for spring installation

There's no rush. No deadline until February 28th. Just an invitation to start imagining.

Want to see what's possible for your backyard? Our free 3D design consultation shows you exactly what your future could look like.

Hi [First Name],

Happy New Year!

You know that thing you've been wanting to do for years? That backyard transformation you keep putting off?

This is the year.

I'm not just saying that because I sell pools. I'm saying it because I've watched families delay this decision year after year, always finding a reason to wait.

"Maybe next year."
"When the kids are a little older."
"When we have more saved."
"When we're less busy."

And then one day they finally do it, and they all say the same thing:

"We wish we'd done this sooner."

2027 COULD BE DIFFERENT:

- January-February: Design your dream pool with our full attention
- March: Lock in your spring installation slot
- April-May: Watch your backyard transform
- June: Host your first pool party
- Forever: Wonder why you waited so long

The window for winter planning is open. Winter pricing ($5,000-$7,500 off) ends February 28th.

After that, spring prices take effect and the rush begins.

Here's to new beginnings,

P.S. SPECIAL: Sign your contract by January 15 and get an extra $1,000 off. That's up to $8,500 in total savings.

Hi [First Name],

Let me tell you what happens during a winter design consultation.

We don't rush. We don't watch the clock. We don't try to squeeze you in between other appointments.

We sit with you. We listen. We ask questions. We actually get to know what you want.

THE WINTER DESIGN EXPERIENCE:

Step 1: Extended Consultation (60-90 minutes)
We visit your property, assess the space, and have a real conversation about your vision. No pressure, no sales tactics.

Step 2: Custom 3D Design
Our team creates a photorealistic rendering of your pool in your actual backyard. You see exactly what it will look like.

Step 3: Revisions Until Perfect
Don't like something? We change it. Want to try a different shape? We show you. In winter, we have time to iterate until you're thrilled.

Step 4: Feature Exploration
Tanning ledge? LED lighting? Built-in spa? Pool heater? Automation? We walk you through every option so you can make informed decisions.

Step 5: Transparent Proposal
You receive a detailed quote with no hidden fees. What you see is what you pay. No surprises.

This is what design should feel like. Not rushed. Not pressured. Just thoughtful.

The winter window closes February 28. After that, the spring rush begins.

Hi [First Name],

I want to give you a straightforward update on pricing.

On March 1st, our prices increase.

This isn't a sales tactic. It's just how our business works:

- Material costs have increased
- Labor costs have increased
- Spring demand drives prices up
- Winter pricing is only available in winter

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:

Before February 28:
- Winter pricing: $5,000-$7,500 off
- Free 3D design package
- Free permit filing
- Priority spring scheduling
- Current rates locked in

After March 1:
- Spring pricing takes effect (higher)
- No winter discount available
- Compete for spring slots
- Pay increased rates

THE DIFFERENCE:

Same pool
Same quality
Same installation
$5,000-$7,500 more expensive

If you've been thinking about a pool, the next 3 weeks represent your best pricing until next winter.

[BUTTON: LOCK IN WINTER PRICING]

I'm not trying to pressure you. I'm just making sure you have the information.

Hi [First Name],

This is my final message about winter pricing.

The deadline is February 28 - six days from now.

WHAT'S ENDING:
- Winter discount ($5,000-$7,500 off)
- Free 3D design package
- Free permit filing
- Current pricing

WHAT'S STARTING MARCH 1:
- Spring pricing (higher)
- Competition for limited slots
- Standard rates for design/permits
- The rush

I know this is a big decision. And I know winter might not feel like pool season.

But here's what I've learned after years in this business:

The families who are happiest with their pools are usually the ones who planned in winter. They had time to think. Time to design. Time to make it perfect.

And they saved thousands of dollars doing it.

If that sounds like what you want, you have 6 days to make it happen.

No matter what you decide, I hope your 2027 is wonderful.

Bryce Dude
Owner, Tri-State Aquatic Solutions

P.S. If you're truly not ready this year, that's okay. Reply "SPRING" and I'll add you to our spring campaign list. You'll miss the winter pricing, but you'll be first to know when spring availability opens.
