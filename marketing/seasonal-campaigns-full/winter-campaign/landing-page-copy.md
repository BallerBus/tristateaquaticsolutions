### Q: Why is winter pricing lower?
A: Simple economics. Spring is our busiest season with high demand. Winter is slower, so we offer significant discounts to customers who plan ahead.

### Q: When would my pool be installed?
A: Winter planners get priority spring scheduling. Most installations happen in April-May, with you swimming by early summer.

### Q: What if I'm not ready to decide?
A: Winter planning is perfect for that. Take your time with design - the deposit isn't required until you're confident.
