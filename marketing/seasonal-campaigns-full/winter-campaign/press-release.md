# Pool Builder Encourages "Dream and Design" Approach to Winter Pool Planning

*Tri-State Aquatic Solutions offers $5,000-$7,500 off installations booked through February, helping homeowners beat spring rush*

---

**HOCKESSIN, DE (December 1, 2026)** - Tri-State Aquatic Solutions today launched its annual "Dream and Design" winter planning campaign, offering homeowners $5,000 to $7,500 off pool installations booked through February 28.

The campaign encourages homeowners to use the winter months for thoughtful pool planning rather than waiting for spring's rush.

"Winter is actually the ideal time to plan a pool," said owner Bryce Dude. "Families have time to think, explore options, and design something perfect - without the pressure of a packed spring calendar."

## Winter Planning Advantages

The company highlights several benefits to winter planning:

- **Significant Savings:** $5,000-$7,500 off installation costs
- **Unrushed Design:** Extended consultations and unlimited revisions
- **Priority Scheduling:** First in line for spring installation
- **Price Protection:** Lock in current pricing before 2027 increases

## Gift Card Program

As part of the campaign, Tri-State Aquatic Solutions introduced a $500 Design Consultation Gift Card, intended as a unique holiday gift option for families considering a pool.

"It's a way to give someone the start of their dream," Dude explained. "The $500 is credited toward their project if they proceed."

## Spring Timeline

Customers who plan during winter can expect the following timeline:
- January-February: Consultation and design
- February: Finalize plans and deposit
- March: Permits and preparation
- April-May: Installation
- June: Swimming

The winter planning special ends February 28, 2027, with spring pricing taking effect March 1.
