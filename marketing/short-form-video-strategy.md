### Filming Tips for Job Sites

**Safety First:**
- Never film near active excavation without proper distance
- Hard hats when cranes are operating
- Clear filming zones with crew beforehand
- No filming electrical work in progress

**Best Shots to Capture:**
1. **Excavation:**
   - Wide shot of excavator arriving
   - Close-up of bucket scooping
   - Time-lapse from start to finish
   - Final hole reveal

2. **Shell Delivery:**
   - Truck arriving on street
   - Crane extending
   - Slow-motion lift
   - Multiple angles of descent
   - Final settling moment

3. **Progress:**
   - Daily comparison shots from same angle
   - Close-ups of plumbing/equipment
   - Crew working (with permission)
   - Detail shots of craftsmanship

4. **Completion:**
   - Water filling (time-lapse)
   - First light test at night
   - Beauty shots multiple angles
   - Drone flyover if possible

**Lighting Conditions:**
- Best: Golden hour (1 hour before sunset)
- Good: Overcast days (no harsh shadows)
- Challenging: Midday sun (causes reflections)
- Night: LED lights essential for pool features

### Editing Style Guide

**Pacing:**
- Hook in first 1-3 seconds
- Quick cuts for process content (0.5-2 seconds per shot)
- Slower cuts for emotional content (3-5 seconds)
- Always end on strong visual or CTA

**Text Overlays:**
- Bold, readable fonts (no thin scripts)
- High contrast (white text, black outline)
- Lower third for identifying speakers
- Centered for key messages
- Animated text for emphasis

**Color Grading:**
- Consistent warm/premium look
- Boost blues for water clarity
- Don't oversaturate
- Match brand colors where possible

**Transitions:**
- For reveals: Quick cuts or zoom transitions
- For process: Simple cuts or cross-dissolves
- Avoid: Excessive effects, star wipes, etc.

### Caption Best Practices

**Structure:**
```
Hook line (first sentence visible in preview)
[Line break]
Context or value
[Line break]
CTA or question for engagement
[Line break]
Hashtags (TikTok in caption, Instagram in comments or caption)
```

**Example:**
```
This backyard went from "meh" to "let's never leave"

16x36 fiberglass pool installed in just 3 weeks. Tanning ledge, LED lights, the works.

```

### Accessibility (Important!)

**Captions:**
- ALWAYS add captions/subtitles
- Use TikTok's auto-caption feature and CORRECT errors
- For Instagram: Use caption stickers or third-party apps
- Ensure captions don't cover important visuals

**Audio Descriptions:**
- When possible, describe key visuals verbally
- "As you can see, the shell is being lowered..." works for both audio and visual viewers

**Contrast:**
- Text must be readable against all backgrounds
- Use text backgrounds/outlines when needed

**Speed:**
- Don't speak too fast
- Pause between key points
- Allow time for text to be read
