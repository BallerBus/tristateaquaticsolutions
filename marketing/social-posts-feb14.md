## Post 3: "Before" Season Reminder 📋

**Quick question for pool owners:**

When's the last time you had your pool equipment inspected?

Cracked pipes, worn seals, and aging pumps don't fix themselves over winter. A 30-minute pre-season inspection can save you THOUSANDS in emergency repairs mid-July.

We're offering **free pre-season equipment assessments** for new customers through the end of February.

Don't get caught off guard. Let's make sure your pool is summer-ready.

📩 DM "INSPECT" or call us to schedule.
