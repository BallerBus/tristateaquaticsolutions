## Post 1 — Pool Opening Season is Coming

**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Status:** DRAFT — Needs Brandon's approval

### Post Copy:

Spring is coming. That means pool season is almost here.

If you're thinking "I'll just open my pool myself this year" — here's what usually happens:

🚿 You spend 4 hours fighting with the cover
🔧 The pump won't start (because you didn't winterize it right)
💦 Chemicals are way off (hello, green water)
🏊‍♂️ Finally get it running — but it's Memorial Day weekend and you're supposed to be at a BBQ

Sound familiar?

Our spring pool opening takes care of everything:
✅ Remove cover
✅ Start up equipment
✅ Test water chemistry
✅ Balance chemicals
✅ Get you swimming same day

Book your opening now. Spots fill up fast when the weather warms up.

## Post 2 — The "Wait Too Long" Post

**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Status:** DRAFT — Needs Brandon's approval

### Post Copy:

Here's a story we see every year:

Customer calls in late April: "Hey, my pool is green. Can you come fix it?"

We show up. Algae has taken over. Phosphates are through the roof. Filter is clogged with debris from sitting all winter.

Now instead of a 2-hour opening — it's a $600 cleanup, new chemicals, maybe even a new filter.

The difference between a $200 pool opening and a $600 pool rescue?

Timing.

Book your spring opening BEFORE the warm weather hits. It's cheaper, faster, and your pool is ready when you want to swim.

We're booking for March now. Message us or call +1 (610) 870-3113.

Same pool. Same customer. Same spring.

The difference? They called us early.

Don't let your pool turn into a science experiment this spring.

## Post 4 — Quick Tip (Engagement)

Pool pro tip:

Before we come for your spring opening — take ONE photo of your pool with the cover still on.

Why?

So we can see exactly what we're working with before we arrive. Cover condition, water color, any obvious issues. Helps us bring the right parts and chemicals the first time.

Small thing. Saves big time.
