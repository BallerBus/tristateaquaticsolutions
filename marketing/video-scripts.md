**[HOOK - 0:00-0:05]**

*[On camera, direct to lens]*

"Concrete pools are better than fiberglass, right? Actually, that's exactly what concrete pool builders want you to think."

---

**[INTRO - 0:05-0:30]**

*[B-roll: Stunning completed fiberglass pool with family enjoying]*

"I'm Brandon Calloway from Tri-State Aquatic Solutions, and I've installed both fiberglass and concrete pools throughout the Main Line and Delaware. Today I'm going to give you the honest comparison that most pool builders won't - because they only sell one type."

*[Back on camera]*

"By the end of this video, you'll know exactly which pool type is right for your property. Let's break it down."

---

**[SECTION 1: INSTALLATION TIME - 0:30-1:15]**

*[On camera with graphic overlay]*

"First, let's talk timeline. This is where fiberglass really shines."

*[B-roll: Fiberglass pool being delivered on truck, crane setting it]*

"A fiberglass pool is manufactured in a controlled factory environment. It arrives at your home as a complete shell. We excavate, set the pool, connect equipment, and you're swimming in two to four weeks."

*[B-roll: Concrete pool construction - rebar, shotcrete, long timeline]*

"Concrete? You're looking at three to five months minimum. The concrete has to cure for 28 days before you can even start finishing work. I've seen concrete projects stretch to six months with weather delays."

*[On camera]*

"So if you sign a contract in April, with fiberglass you're swimming Memorial Day weekend. With concrete? Maybe Labor Day. Maybe."

---

**[SECTION 2: MAINTENANCE - 1:15-2:00]**

*[On camera]*

"Here's where it gets interesting. Let's talk about what happens AFTER the pool is in."

*[B-roll: Fiberglass smooth surface, water clarity]*

"Fiberglass has a smooth, non-porous gelcoat surface. Algae has nothing to grip onto. Most of our fiberglass pool owners spend maybe fifteen minutes a week on maintenance. Check the chemicals, empty the skimmer, done."

*[B-roll: Person brushing concrete pool walls]*

"Concrete is porous. That rough surface is a perfect home for algae and bacteria. You HAVE to brush the walls every week - we're talking forty-five minutes to an hour. Skip it, and you'll have algae problems."

*[On camera with graphic: Annual cost comparison]*

"Over a year, you're looking at about one thousand dollars in maintenance for fiberglass versus almost three thousand for concrete. Over twenty years? That difference is massive."

---

**[SECTION 3: DURABILITY IN PA/DE - 2:00-2:45]**

*[On camera]*

"Now here's something specific to our area that most national pool companies don't mention."

*[B-roll: Pennsylvania winter, frost on ground]*

"We get about a hundred freeze-thaw cycles every year in the Main Line. A hundred times that ground expands and contracts."

*[Graphic: Animation of pool flexing vs cracking]*

"Fiberglass flexes with that movement. The material is designed to give slightly. Concrete? It's rigid. Over time, those freeze-thaw cycles create hairline cracks. Water gets in, freezes, expands, makes the crack bigger."

*[On camera]*

"I'm not saying concrete pools fail - properly built ones last decades. But for Pennsylvania's climate, fiberglass is specifically engineered for these conditions."

---

**[SECTION 4: WHEN CONCRETE MAKES SENSE - 2:45-3:30]**

*[On camera]*

"Now, I want to be fair. There ARE situations where concrete is the right choice."

*[B-roll: Large estate pool, infinity edge, unique shapes]*

"If you need a pool wider than sixteen feet - fiberglass shells have to fit on a truck. If you want a truly custom shape, a fifty-foot infinity edge, or you're building something for a major estate property - concrete gives you unlimited options."

*[On camera]*

"About ten percent of our clients genuinely need concrete's flexibility. The other ninety percent? They can get exactly what they want with fiberglass, faster and with less lifetime hassle."

---

**[SECTION 5: THE BOTTOM LINE - 3:30-4:00]**

*[On camera, summary graphic]*

"So here's the truth: Fiberglass isn't a budget alternative to concrete. It's a modern engineering solution that delivers luxury results with less time, less maintenance, and better value."

"Concrete has its place for truly custom projects. But for most Main Line homeowners who want a beautiful pool without endless maintenance? Fiberglass is the smarter choice."

---

**[CTA - 4:00-4:30]**

*[On camera, warmer tone]*

"Look, I install both types. I don't have a horse in this race - I want to match you with the right pool for YOUR property."

*[B-roll: Happy family in pool, beautiful backyard]*

"If you're ready to explore your options, schedule a free consultation at tristateaquaticsolutions.com. We'll walk your property, discuss your vision, and give you honest recommendations."

*[On camera with logo]*

"I'm Brandon Calloway. Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next video."

**Platform:** YouTube, Facebook, Instagram (IGTV)
**Goal:** Set realistic expectations, differentiate from slow competitors

#### SCRIPT

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:05]**

*[On camera, slightly frustrated tone]*

"If a pool company tells you six months for installation, they're either building concrete or they're lying to you."

---

**[INTRO - 0:05-0:25]**

*[On camera]*

"I'm Brandon from Tri-State Aquatic Solutions. One of the first questions everyone asks is 'how long will this take?' And I get it - you don't want your backyard torn up all summer."

"Let me break down exactly what a realistic timeline looks like."

---

**[SECTION 1: FIBERGLASS TIMELINE - 0:25-1:15]**

*[On camera with week-by-week graphic]*

"For fiberglass pools, here's what we're looking at:"

*[B-roll: Each stage mentioned]*

"Week one: We excavate your yard, set the pool shell with a crane, and backfill around it. By Friday, you have a pool in the ground."

"Week two: Our crews install all the plumbing and electrical. Pumps, filters, heaters - everything gets connected."

"Weeks two and three: Decking and finishing work. Concrete, pavers, whatever you've chosen."

"Week three or four: Final inspection, fill the pool, balance chemistry, and hand you the keys."

*[On camera]*

"That's it. Three to four weeks from breaking ground to your first swim. And that's not rushing - that's just how efficient fiberglass installation is."

---

**[SECTION 2: WHY CONCRETE TAKES LONGER - 1:15-1:45]**

*[On camera]*

"Now, if you go concrete, add three to four months to that timeline."

*[B-roll: Concrete curing, construction delays]*

"Concrete has to cure for almost a month before you can finish it. Then you've got tile work, coping, interior plastering - each step needs its own cure time."

*[On camera]*

"Plus concrete is at the mercy of weather. Rain delays, cold snaps, humidity problems. I've seen concrete projects drag on for six months."

---

**[SECTION 3: PLANNING TIMELINE - 1:45-2:15]**

*[On camera with calendar graphic]*

"Here's the timeline most people don't think about: permitting."

"In Pennsylvania townships like Lower Merion or Radnor, add four to eight weeks for permit approval. Delaware's usually faster - two to four weeks."

*[On camera]*

"So if you want to be swimming by Memorial Day, you need to contact us by February. July Fourth? March at the latest."

"The biggest regret I hear from homeowners: 'I wish we'd started sooner.'"

---

**[CTA - 2:15-2:45]**

*[On camera, warmer tone]*

"Ready to stop thinking about it and start swimming? Visit tristateaquaticsolutions.com to schedule your free design consultation."

*[B-roll: Pool completion celebration, family jumping in]*

"We'll give you an honest timeline for your specific project - no surprises, no delays."

### 3. Pool Permits in PA & DE Explained

**Duration:** 3-4 minutes
**Platform:** YouTube, Facebook
**Goal:** Demonstrate local expertise, remove fear of permitting process

#### Thumbnail

---

#### SCRIPT

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:05]**

*[On camera, direct]*

"Building a pool without permits can void your insurance, kill your home sale, and cost you fifty thousand dollars. Here's what you actually need."

---

**[INTRO - 0:05-0:30]**

*[On camera]*

"I'm Brandon from Tri-State Aquatic Solutions. Pool permits sound intimidating, but I've navigated hundreds of them across the Main Line and Delaware."

*[B-roll: Township buildings, permit office]*

"The good news? It's completely manageable when you know what to expect. Let me walk you through it."

---

**[SECTION 1: WHY PERMITS MATTER - 0:30-1:00]**

*[On camera]*

"First, let me be direct: never work with a contractor who says permits aren't necessary."

*[Graphic: Three risks]*

"Without permits, three things happen. Your homeowner's insurance won't cover pool accidents - at all. When you sell your house, buyers will find out and deals fall apart. And the township can make you remove the pool entirely."

*[On camera]*

"Permits protect you. They verify safety, electrical compliance, and proper construction. It's worth the few hundred dollars."

---

**[SECTION 2: PA REQUIREMENTS - 1:00-2:00]**

*[On camera with township graphic]*

"Pennsylvania doesn't have state-level pool permits. It's handled by each township, which means requirements vary."

*[Graphic: Township breakdown as mentioned]*

"Lower Merion - plan on four to eight weeks and about four hundred to six hundred dollars. They're thorough. Ten-foot setbacks from property lines, four-foot fence required."

"Radnor Township - three to six weeks, two-fifty to five hundred. Fifteen-foot setback from rear property line."

"Chester County townships - generally three to five weeks, two to four hundred dollars."

*[On camera]*

"Every township wants a site plan showing where the pool goes, setback measurements, and your fence plan. Plus separate electrical permits."

---

**[SECTION 3: DELAWARE REQUIREMENTS - 2:00-2:30]**

*[On camera with DE graphic]*

"Delaware is generally faster and more streamlined."

"New Castle County - two to four weeks, one-fifty to three-fifty. Standard ten-foot setbacks. Hockessin falls under county jurisdiction, so same rules."

*[On camera]*

"If you're in Delaware, count yourself lucky. The process is significantly less complicated than most PA townships."

---

**[SECTION 4: HOW WE HANDLE IT - 2:30-3:15]**

*[On camera, reassuring tone]*

"Here's the thing: you don't have to deal with any of this yourself."

*[B-roll: Paperwork, permit documents]*

"At Tri-State, permit management is included in every project. We prepare all applications, submit everything, coordinate with township staff, schedule inspections, and handle any questions that come up."

*[On camera]*

"Your job? Sign the applications as property owner and approve your pool design. That's it."

*[B-roll: Happy homeowner reviewing plans]*

"We've done this hundreds of times. We know which inspectors are strict about what, which townships move fast, and how to avoid delays."

---

**[CTA - 3:15-3:45]**

*[On camera]*

"Want to know if your property is permit-ready? Schedule a free consultation at tristateaquaticsolutions.com."

"We'll review your property, identify any potential challenges, and give you a realistic timeline before you commit to anything."

### 4. Is a Plunge Pool Right for You?

**Duration:** 2-3 minutes
**Platform:** YouTube, Instagram (IGTV), Facebook
**Goal:** Introduce plunge pools as luxury option, not compromise

#### Thumbnail

- Text: "SMALL YARD?" or "PLUNGE POOLS"
- Modern backyard setting

---

#### SCRIPT

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:05]**

*[On camera]*

"Think your backyard is too small for a pool? What if I told you that's actually an advantage?"

---

**[INTRO - 0:05-0:25]**

*[B-roll: Stunning modern plunge pool in compact yard]*

"I'm Brandon from Tri-State Aquatic Solutions. Plunge pools are exploding in popularity - and not just for small properties. They're becoming the intentional choice for homeowners who want luxury without the oversized footprint."

---

**[SECTION 1: WHAT IS A PLUNGE POOL - 0:25-0:55]**

*[On camera with graphic]*

"A plunge pool is typically ten to sixteen feet, designed for cooling off, relaxing, and entertaining rather than lap swimming. Think of it as a concentrated luxury experience."

*[B-roll: Various plunge pool designs]*

"They're perfect for cocktail parties, morning cold plunges, after-work relaxation, or heated year-round use. Some of our clients use them as the centerpiece of outdoor living spaces that cost less than traditional pools but feel more exclusive."

---

**[SECTION 2: WHO SHOULD CONSIDER A PLUNGE POOL - 0:55-1:35]**

*[On camera]*

"A plunge pool makes sense if..."

*[Graphics for each point]*

"One: Your yard is under thirty feet deep. Setback requirements in most townships don't leave room for a traditional pool."

"Two: You want a pool but hate maintenance. Smaller water volume means less chemicals, less cleaning, less everything."

"Three: You're into wellness. Cold plunge therapy is huge right now. Heat it for spa-like relaxation. These pools do both."

"Four: You entertain. A plunge pool with a fire feature and outdoor kitchen creates an incredible entertaining space for a fraction of the cost of a full pool."

---

**[SECTION 3: COST AND TIMELINE - 1:35-2:00]**

*[On camera with graphics]*

"Let's talk numbers. A quality plunge pool installation runs thirty-five to sixty thousand depending on features. That's about half the cost of a traditional pool."

"Timeline? As fast as two weeks from groundbreaking to first splash. They're pre-manufactured for quick installation."

*[On camera]*

"And because they're smaller, permits often move faster and have fewer complications."

---

**[SECTION 4: THE REAL QUESTION - 2:00-2:25]**

*[On camera, thoughtful]*

"Here's what I tell clients: Don't ask 'is my yard big enough for a pool?' Ask 'what do I actually want to DO with my pool?'"

*[B-roll: Family relaxing in plunge pool]*

"If the answer is swim laps, you need a bigger pool. If it's relax, entertain, and enjoy your backyard? A plunge pool might be exactly right."

---

**[CTA - 2:25-2:50]**

*[On camera]*

"Curious whether a plunge pool works for your property? Let's talk. Schedule a free consultation at tristateaquaticsolutions.com."

"I'll walk your yard, understand your vision, and tell you honestly what's possible."

*[On camera with logo]*

"I'm Brandon. Your backyard oasis doesn't have to be Olympic-sized."

### 5. How to Finance Your Dream Pool

**Duration:** 3-4 minutes
**Platform:** YouTube, Facebook
**Goal:** Remove financial barrier, present options professionally

#### Thumbnail

#### SCRIPT

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:05]**

*[On camera]*

"You don't need fifty thousand dollars in cash to get a pool this summer. Let me show you how smart homeowners are financing their backyards."

---

**[INTRO - 0:05-0:30]**

*[On camera]*

"I'm Brandon from Tri-State Aquatic Solutions. Money is the number one reason people put off their pool dreams. But here's the thing - most of our clients don't pay cash. They use financing options that make pool ownership surprisingly accessible."

*[B-roll: Beautiful backyard pool]*

"Let me walk you through your options."

---

**[SECTION 1: HOME EQUITY - 0:30-1:15]**

*[On camera with graphics]*

"Option one: Home equity loans or HELOCs. If you've built equity in your home, this is often the best rate you'll find."

*[Graphic: Interest rate comparison]*

"Current rates for home equity loans are running around seven to nine percent. A fifty thousand dollar pool over ten years? That's roughly five fifty to six hundred a month."

*[On camera]*

"The advantage here is the interest is often tax-deductible since you're improving your property. Plus, a pool actually adds to your home's value - studies show eight to fifteen percent in neighborhoods like ours."

*[B-roll: Home exterior, property value concept]*

"You're essentially using your home's equity to create more equity. That's smart money management."

---

**[SECTION 2: POOL-SPECIFIC FINANCING - 1:15-1:50]**

*[On camera]*

"Option two: Pool-specific financing through lenders like Lyon Financial or Viking Capital."

"These are unsecured loans designed specifically for pool projects. You don't use your home as collateral."

*[Graphic: Monthly payment examples]*

"Rates are higher - typically nine to fourteen percent - but approval is faster. We're talking twenty-four to forty-eight hours for a decision."

"On a fifty thousand dollar pool, you're looking at four hundred to six hundred a month depending on term length."

*[On camera]*

"We work with several lenders and can help you find the best fit for your situation."

---

**[SECTION 3: OTHER OPTIONS - 1:50-2:30]**

*[On camera]*

"A few other options worth mentioning."

*[Graphic list]*

"Cash-out refinancing - if rates make sense, you could refinance your mortgage and pull out pool money at your mortgage rate."

"Personal loans - faster but higher rates. Better for smaller projects."

"Credit cards - only if you have a zero-percent promotional offer and can pay it off in time. Otherwise, avoid."

*[On camera, practical tone]*

"What I don't recommend? Draining your savings. Your emergency fund should stay intact. Financing lets you get the pool now while keeping your financial safety net."

---

**[SECTION 4: THE VALUE PERSPECTIVE - 2:30-3:15]**

*[On camera, warmer tone]*

"Let me share how I think about this."

*[B-roll: Family enjoying pool, summer memories]*

"A pool isn't just an expense - it's years of family memories, summer entertaining, daily stress relief, and yes, increased property value."

"If your kids are eight and twelve, you have maybe ten summers before they're off to college. That's five hundred dollars a month for ten summers of memories versus... what? A car payment?"

*[On camera]*

"I'm not here to pressure anyone. But I've never had a client tell me they regretted getting their pool. I HAVE had clients tell me they regret waiting."

---

**[CTA - 3:15-3:45]**

*[On camera]*

"Want to know what your pool would actually cost monthly? Start with a consultation at tristateaquaticsolutions.com. We'll design your pool, give you an accurate quote, and connect you with financing options."

"No obligation, no pressure. Just honest numbers so you can make the right decision for your family."

*[On camera with logo]*

"I'm Brandon. Your dream pool is more affordable than you think."

### 6. Meet Brandon: Why I Started Tri-State Aquatic

**Duration:** 2-3 minutes
**Platform:** YouTube, Facebook, Instagram (IGTV), Website About Page
**Goal:** Build personal connection, establish trust and authenticity

#### Thumbnail

#### SCRIPT

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:05]**

*[On camera, sitting in casual setting - maybe near a pool]*

"Most pool companies send you a salesperson. I answer my own phone. Let me tell you why."

---

**[SECTION 1: THE BEGINNING - 0:05-0:45]**

*[On camera, conversational]*

"I'm Brandon Calloway, and I started Tri-State Aquatic Solutions because I saw something broken in this industry."

*[B-roll: Generic pool company trucks, big corporate office]*

"I worked in pool construction before going out on my own. And here's what I saw: big companies treat customers like transactions. You get a salesperson who disappears after the contract, crews that show up when they feel like it, and if there's a problem? Good luck reaching anyone who cares."

*[On camera]*

"I knew there had to be a better way."

---

**[SECTION 2: WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT - 0:45-1:30]**

*[On camera]*

"When you work with Tri-State, you work with me. I'm at your consultation. I'm on your job site. I'm the one you call when you have questions."

*[B-roll: Brandon on job site, meeting with homeowners, inspecting work]*

"This isn't just a job for me. Every pool we build is a reflection of my name, my reputation, and my commitment to this community."

*[On camera]*

"I live here. I'm raising my family here. I run into my customers at the grocery store, at youth sports, around town. That accountability changes everything."

*[B-roll: Local Main Line scenes - downtown areas, community shots]*

"When your pool builder is your neighbor, you know they're going to do it right."

---

**[SECTION 3: OUR APPROACH - 1:30-2:00]**

*[On camera]*

"Here's what I promise every client:"

*[Graphics overlay as each is mentioned]*

"Transparent pricing. You'll know exactly what you're paying for, with no surprise change orders."

"Clear communication. Weekly updates, responsive answers, no ghosting."

"Premium results. We use the best equipment - Pentair, Hayward, Jandy - because your pool should last decades."

"And personal service. My cell phone number. Any time."

---

**[SECTION 4: THE VISION - 2:00-2:25]**

*[On camera, slightly more passionate]*

"My vision is simple: I want Tri-State Aquatic to be the pool company that Main Line homeowners trust and recommend."

*[B-roll: Happy customers, completed projects]*

"Not the biggest company. The best company. The one where the owner still cares about every single project."

*[On camera]*

"That's who we are. That's who we'll always be."

---

**[CTA - 2:25-2:50]**

*[On camera, warm tone]*

"If that sounds like the kind of company you want to work with, I'd love to meet you. Schedule a consultation at tristateaquaticsolutions.com, or just give me a call. You'll actually get me."

*[Smiling to camera with logo]*

"I'm Brandon Calloway. Let's build something amazing together."

---

**[INTRO - 0:05-0:25]**

*[On camera]*

"I'm Brandon from Tri-State Aquatic Solutions. One of the biggest fears homeowners have is not knowing what to expect. So let me pull back the curtain and show you exactly how we transform backyards."

*[B-roll: Quick montage of installation stages]*

---

**[STEP 1: CONSULTATION - 0:25-0:55]**

*[On camera]*

"Step one: Your free design consultation."

*[B-roll: Brandon walking property with homeowner]*

"I come to your home, walk your property, and listen to your vision. We talk about how you'll use the pool, what features matter to you, and any constraints like budget or timeline."

"I'll measure setbacks, check for potential issues, and give you a realistic sense of what's possible. No pressure, no obligation - just honest conversation."

*[On camera]*

"Most consultations are about an hour. By the end, you'll know if we're the right fit."

---

**[STEP 2: DESIGN - 0:55-1:25]**

*[On camera with design renderings on screen]*

"Step two: Custom design and quote."

"Based on our conversation, I create a 3D rendering of your pool. You can see exactly what it will look like in your backyard."

*[B-roll: 3D design software, renderings]*

"We make adjustments until you love it. Then you get a detailed line-item quote - every cost explained. Pool shell, excavation, equipment, decking, permits - everything."

*[On camera]*

"That quote is your final price. No change orders, no surprises."

---

**[STEP 3: PERMITTING - 1:25-1:55]**

*[On camera]*

"Step three: We handle all permits."

*[B-roll: Permit documents, township buildings]*

"Once you approve the design, we prepare and submit permit applications to your township. We handle all communication with inspectors and schedule all required reviews."

"This takes two to six weeks depending on your municipality. We keep you updated throughout."

*[On camera]*

"Your involvement? Sign the applications. That's it."

---

**[STEP 4: EXCAVATION - 1:55-2:25]**

*[On camera]*

"Step four: Excavation day."

*[B-roll: Excavator arriving, digging hole, progress]*

"This is the exciting part - and yes, it's a little messy. Heavy equipment arrives, and within a day or two, we've dug the hole for your pool."

"We're careful with your property - protecting existing landscaping, managing access routes, and cleaning up daily."

*[On camera]*

"By the end of day two or three, you'll see the shape of your future pool."

---

**[STEP 5: POOL SETTING - 2:25-2:55]**

*[On camera]*

"Step five: Setting the pool shell."

*[B-roll: Crane arriving, fiberglass shell being delivered and set]*

"For fiberglass pools, your pre-manufactured shell arrives on a truck. A crane lifts it into the excavated hole. It's actually pretty incredible to watch."

"We level the pool precisely, then backfill around it with the right material to ensure stability."

*[On camera]*

"This happens in a single day. By evening, you have an actual pool sitting in your backyard."

**[STEP 6: PLUMBING & ELECTRICAL - 2:55-3:25]**

*[On camera]*

"Step six: Plumbing and electrical."

*[B-roll: Pipes being installed, equipment pad, electrical work]*

"Our crews install all the plumbing lines, returns, and drains. We pour the equipment pad and run all electrical."

"Pumps, filters, heaters, automation systems, lights - everything gets connected and tested."

*[On camera]*

"This phase takes about a week. We schedule inspections as required."

---

**[STEP 7: DECKING - 3:25-3:55]**

*[On camera]*

"Step seven: Decking and coping."

*[B-roll: Concrete pour, paver installation, coping work]*

"The pool shell is done - now we're building everything around it. Coping goes on first - that's the material around the pool's edge."

"Then your deck: concrete, pavers, natural stone - whatever you've chosen. This frames your pool and creates the outdoor living space."

*[On camera]*

"Decking usually takes one to two weeks depending on complexity."

---

**[STEP 8: FINAL STEPS - 3:55-4:25]**

*[On camera]*

"Step eight: Finishing touches and startup."

*[B-roll: Fence installation, landscaping, pool filling]*

"Fencing goes in to meet code requirements. Any final landscaping. Equipment gets final testing."

"Then we fill the pool, balance the water chemistry, and do a complete walkthrough with you."

*[B-roll: Brandon walking through with homeowner]*

"I show you how everything works - pumps, automation, chemistry basics. You get all your manuals, warranties, and my direct phone number."

*[On camera]*

"Then... you swim."

---

**[SUMMARY & CTA - 4:25-5:00]**

*[On camera with timeline graphic]*

"From consultation to first swim: eight to twelve weeks total for most projects. Three to four weeks of that is permitting. Actual construction? About three to four weeks."

*[On camera, warm tone]*

"Throughout the process, you get weekly updates. Photos, progress reports, and direct access to me. No wondering what's happening - you're informed every step."

"Ready to get started? Visit tristateaquaticsolutions.com and schedule your consultation."

*[On camera with logo]*

"I'm Brandon. Let's build your backyard oasis."

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:05]**

*[Customer testimonial clip]*

"We talked to three pool companies. Brandon was the only one who actually listened."

---

**[INTRO - 0:05-0:20]**

*[On camera - Brandon]*

"I could tell you why Tri-State is different. But I'd rather let our customers tell you themselves."

*[B-roll: Beautiful pool projects]*

---

**[TESTIMONIAL 1 - 0:20-0:50]**

*[Customer on camera - ideally at their pool]*

"The big companies sent salespeople. Brandon came himself. He walked our yard, really understood what we wanted, and designed a pool that was exactly right for our family."

*[B-roll: Their pool, family using it]*

"When we had questions during construction, we'd text Brandon directly. Try doing that with Anthony & Sylvan."

---

**[BRANDON RESPONDS - 0:50-1:05]**

*[On camera - Brandon]*

"Personal service isn't a marketing slogan for us. I believe the owner should be involved in every project. Your pool is too important to hand off to strangers."

---

**[TESTIMONIAL 2 - 1:05-1:35]**

*[Different customer on camera]*

"What surprised us was the transparency. Brandon gave us a detailed quote - every line item explained. And that was the final price. No change orders, no 'oh we found this' upcharges."

*[B-roll: Their pool, quote documents]*

"After dealing with contractors who nickel-and-dime you, it was refreshing to work with someone honest."

---

**[BRANDON RESPONDS - 1:35-1:50]**

*[On camera - Brandon]*

"I hate surprise costs as much as you do. That's why we do thorough site evaluations upfront. Your quote includes everything. If something unexpected happens, that's on us, not you."

---

**[TESTIMONIAL 3 - 1:50-2:15]**

*[Third customer on camera]*

"Our neighbors used a national chain and their project took five months. Ours was done in four weeks. Same size pool. Brandon's team was professional, efficient, and clean."

*[B-roll: Their pool, construction timelapse if available]*

"We were swimming Memorial Day weekend. They weren't in until August."

---

**[CLOSING - 2:15-2:45]**

*[On camera - Brandon]*

"Here's what our clients have in common: they wanted a partner, not just a contractor. Someone who cares about getting it right, stays in touch throughout the project, and stands behind their work long after the check clears."

"That's what Tri-State Aquatic Solutions is built on."

*[B-roll: Multiple completed pools]*

### 10. 3 Things Your Pool Installer Won't Tell You

**Duration:** 90 seconds
**Platform:** Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts
**Goal:** Engagement through controversy/curiosity, establish expertise

#### Thumbnail/Cover
- Brandon with finger to lips ("secret" gesture)
- Text: "POOL SECRETS" or "3 THINGS"
- Slightly mysterious vibe

---

#### SCRIPT

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:05]**

*[Brandon to camera, slightly conspiratorial tone]*

"Three things pool installers won't tell you - but I will."

---

**[THING 1 - 0:05-0:30]**

*[On camera]*

"Number one: The quote is not the quote."

*[B-roll: Contract document, calculator]*

"Most big pool companies give you a lowball number to get you excited. Then halfway through construction - 'Oh, the soil was rockier than expected.' 'Oh, you wanted a heater? That's extra.'"

*[Back on camera]*

"Get EVERYTHING in writing. Every line item. If they won't detail the quote, walk away."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** "1. GET IT IN WRITING"

---

**[THING 2 - 0:30-0:55]**

*[On camera]*

"Number two: Concrete isn't automatically better than fiberglass."

*[B-roll: Both pool types]*

"Concrete builders will tell you fiberglass is 'cheap' because they don't sell it. The truth? Modern fiberglass delivers luxury results with faster installation and way less maintenance."

*[Back on camera]*

"It's not about which is 'better' - it's about which is right for YOUR situation. Be suspicious of anyone who only pushes one type."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** "2. FIBERGLASS ISN'T CHEAP"

---

**[THING 3 - 0:55-1:20]**

*[On camera]*

"Number three: Permits matter more than you think."

*[B-roll: Permit documents, township building]*

"If a contractor says 'permits aren't really necessary,' run. Unpermitted pools void your insurance, kill home sales, and can result in forced removal."

*[Back on camera]*

"Any legitimate pool builder handles permits as part of the job. If they're trying to skip it, ask yourself what else they're cutting corners on."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** "3. ALWAYS GET PERMITS"

---

**[CTA - 1:20-1:30]**

*[On camera, warmer tone]*

"Want a pool installer who's actually honest with you? Link in bio. Free consultation, no pressure."

**TEXT OVERLAY:** "TRISTATEAQUATICSOLUTIONS.COM"

- Numbered text overlays as each point is made
- Potential for engagement: "What's number 4? Drop it in comments"
