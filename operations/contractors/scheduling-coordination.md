### Critical Path Analysis

#### Critical Path Items
These items directly affect project completion date:

1. **Permits** - Cannot start until approved
2. **Excavation** - All trades depend on this
3. **Shell (gunite/shotcrete)** - Long cure time
4. **Tile and coping** - Must complete before deck
5. **Decking** - Must complete before equipment
6. **Interior finish** - Must complete before fill
7. **Final inspection** - Required for handover

#### Float Activities
These items can shift within constraints:

- Fence (can install after barrier inspection point)
- Landscape (can install after fence)
- Some electrical finishing
- Equipment mounting details

### Trade Dependencies Matrix

| Trade | Depends On | Must Complete Before |
|-------|------------|---------------------|
| Excavation | Permits, Layout | Plumbing, Electrical |
| Plumbing (rough) | Excavation | Steel, Shell |
| Electrical (rough) | Excavation | Steel, Shell |
| Steel/Shell | Plumbing, Electrical rough | Tile, Coping |
