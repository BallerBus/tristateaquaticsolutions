## Overhead Allocation

### Overhead Categories

#### Fixed Overhead (Monthly)

| Category | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Facility Rent/Mortgage | $3,500 | $42,000 |
| Utilities | $800 | $9,600 |
| Insurance (GL, Property) | $2,500 | $30,000 |
| Vehicle Payments | $2,800 | $33,600 |
| Software/Technology | $1,200 | $14,400 |
| Professional Services | $1,500 | $18,000 |
| Administrative Salaries | $8,000 | $96,000 |
| **Total Fixed** | **$20,300** | **$243,600** |

#### Variable Overhead

| Category | Est. Annual | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Vehicle Fuel | $24,000 | Based on usage |
| Vehicle Maintenance | $12,000 | |
| Office Supplies | $3,600 | |
| Marketing | $36,000 | |
| Training | $6,000 | |
| Miscellaneous | $12,000 | |
| **Total Variable** | **$93,600** | |

#### Total Annual Overhead
**$337,200**

### Overhead Allocation Methods

#### Method 1: Percentage of Direct Costs
```
Overhead Rate = Total Overhead / Total Direct Costs

Example:
Annual Overhead: $337,200
Annual Direct Costs: $1,800,000
Overhead Rate: 18.7% (round to 19%)

Per Job Overhead = (Labor + Materials + Equipment + Subs) × 19%
```

#### Method 2: Percentage of Revenue
```
Overhead Rate = Total Overhead / Total Revenue

Example:
Annual Overhead: $337,200
Annual Revenue: $2,700,000
Overhead Rate: 12.5%

Per Job Overhead = Selling Price × 12.5%
```

#### Method 3: Per-Job Fixed Allocation
```
Jobs per Year: 60
Overhead per Job: $337,200 / 60 = $5,620

Adjust for job size:
Small Job (<$60K): $4,000
Medium Job ($60K-$100K): $5,500
Large Job ($100K-$150K): $7,500
XL Job (>$150K): $10,000+
```

### Recommended Approach

Use **Method 1 (15% of direct costs)** as standard overhead allocation:
- Simple to calculate
- Scales with job size
- Covers most scenarios

Adjust overhead allocation if:
- Job requires unusual coordination (increase)
- Job is extremely straightforward (may decrease)
- Customer provides significant self-management (decrease)

## Profitability Analysis

### Job Profitability Calculation

```
SELLING PRICE
- Direct Labor (fully loaded)
- Materials
- Equipment
- Subcontractors
- Permits/Fees
= GROSS PROFIT

- Overhead Allocation
= NET PROJECT PROFIT

Net Profit Margin = Net Project Profit / Selling Price × 100
```

### Sample Profitability Analysis

**Project:** Medium Pool with Stamped Deck
**Selling Price:** $85,000

| Category | Estimated | Actual | Variance |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Labor | $4,989 | $5,234 | ($245) |
| Materials | $32,500 | $31,800 | $700 |
| Equipment | $1,200 | $1,150 | $50 |
| Subcontractors | $4,500 | $4,800 | ($300) |
| Permits | $1,200 | $1,200 | $0 |
| **Direct Costs** | **$44,389** | **$44,184** | **$205** |
| **Gross Profit** | **$40,611** | **$40,816** | **$205** |
| Gross Margin | 47.8% | 48.0% | +0.2% |
| Overhead (15%) | $6,658 | $6,628 | $30 |
| **Net Profit** | **$33,953** | **$34,188** | **$235** |
| Net Margin | 39.9% | 40.2% | +0.3% |

### Profitability Targets

| Metric | Target | Minimum | Action Trigger |
|--------|--------|---------|----------------|
| Gross Margin | 45%+ | 35% | Review if <35% |
| Net Margin | 35%+ | 25% | Review if <25% |
| Labor % of Revenue | <8% | <12% | Review if >12% |
| Material % of Revenue | 35-40% | <45% | Review if >45% |
| Overhead % of Revenue | 12-15% | <18% | Review if >18% |

### Profitability Review Process

#### Weekly
- Review labor hours vs. estimate for active jobs
- Flag any material overruns
- Address issues before they compound

#### At Job Completion
- Complete full cost reconciliation within 5 days
- Calculate actual margins
- Document variances and causes
- Update estimating data if needed

#### Monthly
- Review profitability for all completed jobs
- Calculate average margins by job type
- Identify trends (positive and negative)
- Adjust pricing or processes as needed

#### Quarterly
- Full profitability analysis by:
  - Job type
  - Salesperson
  - Crew
  - Customer type
- Benchmark against targets
- Strategic adjustments

### Variance Analysis

When actual differs from estimate by >10%:

1. **Identify the variance**
   - Which category? (Labor, materials, etc.)
   - How much?

2. **Determine the cause**
   - Estimating error
   - Scope change
   - Site conditions
   - Efficiency issue
   - Pricing change

3. **Document the finding**
   - Note in job file
   - Update estimating database
   - Share in team meeting if systemic

4. **Implement correction**
   - Adjust estimating practices
   - Revise pricing if needed
   - Train team if skill issue
   - Update vendor relationships if pricing issue
