# HOA Approval Process Guide

## Tri-State Aquatic Solutions - HOA Submissions

This guide outlines the process for obtaining Homeowners Association (HOA) approval for swimming pool installations. Many communities in our service area require HOA approval in addition to municipal permits.

---

## Overview

### Why HOA Approval is Required

Most HOAs require approval for:
- Any exterior modification to property
- Construction projects
- Changes visible from common areas or neighboring properties
- Projects that could affect property values

**Important:** HOA approval is separate from municipal permits. You typically need both:
1. HOA architectural approval
2. Township/county building permit

**Timing:** We recommend obtaining HOA approval BEFORE applying for permits, as HOA changes may affect permit application.
