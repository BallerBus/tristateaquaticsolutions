# Pool Inspection Requirements

## Tri-State Aquatic Solutions - Inspection Guide

This document outlines the inspection requirements for residential swimming pool installations in Pennsylvania and Delaware. Proper preparation for each inspection ensures smooth progression through the construction process.

---

## Overview of Required Inspections

Most jurisdictions require the following inspections for pool construction:

1. Pre-Pour / Footing Inspection
2. Electrical Rough-In Inspection
3. Plumbing Inspection (if applicable)
4. Barrier / Fence Inspection
5. Electrical Final Inspection
6. Final Inspection / Certificate of Occupancy

**Important:** Never proceed to the next phase of construction until the current inspection passes. Failed inspections can result in costly rework.

- [ ] No standing water in excavation
- [ ] Stable soil conditions

**Steel Reinforcement:**
- [ ] Rebar size matches specifications (typically #3 or #4)
- [ ] Rebar spacing per plans (typically 12" on center)
- [ ] Proper overlap at splices (minimum 40 bar diameters)
- [ ] Rebar tied securely at all intersections
- [ ] Proper clearance from soil (typically 3" minimum)
- [ ] Step and bench steel in place
- [ ] Bond beam steel in place

**Forming:**
- [ ] Forms plumb and level
- [ ] Bracing adequate
- [ ] Dimensions match approved plans

**Plumbing (if inspected at this phase):**
