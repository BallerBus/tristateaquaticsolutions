## Route Optimization

### Route Building Principles

**Geographic Clustering:**
- Group customers by neighborhood/area
- Minimize drive time between stops
- Account for traffic patterns by time of day
- Create routes that form logical loops

**Time Allocation Standards:**

| Service Type | Time Allocation |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Tier 1 - Essential Care | 20-25 minutes |
| Tier 2 - Complete Care | 35-45 minutes |
| Tier 3 - Premium Care | 45-60 minutes |
| Filter Clean | 30-45 minutes |
| Equipment Diagnosis | 45-60 minutes |
| One-Time Full Clean | 60-90 minutes |
| Pool Opening | 90-120 minutes |
| Pool Closing | 90-120 minutes |

**Route Structure:**
- Maximum 8-10 stops per route (maintenance)
- Maximum 4-6 stops for repair routes
- Include 30 minutes buffer per route
- Schedule difficult access pools earlier
- Account for equipment loading time

### Daily Route Template

**Morning Block (7:00 AM - 12:00 PM):**
- Start with closest stop to technician home
- Hit 4-5 maintenance stops
- Schedule problem pools early
- Allow for morning traffic

**Midday Block (12:00 PM - 5:00 PM):**
- Continue maintenance route
- Schedule call-back repairs
- Emergency response availability
- End near technician home or warehouse

### Route Optimization Process

**Weekly Route Review:**
1. Identify inefficient routes (excessive drive time)
2. Balance workload across technicians
3. Accommodate customer requests when possible
4. Adjust for seasonal schedule changes
5. Plan for new customer integration

**Monthly Route Audit:**
- Review route efficiency metrics
- Adjust for added/removed customers
- Optimize based on technician feedback
- Update drive time estimates
- Identify potential route swaps
