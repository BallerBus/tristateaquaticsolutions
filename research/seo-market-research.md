# SEO & Market Research Report: Tri-State Aquatic Solutions
## Hockessin, Delaware | Targeting Main Line PA & Northern Delaware

**Report Date:** January 30, 2026
**Prepared for:** Tri-State Aquatic Solutions

---

## Executive Summary: Top 10 Actionable Insights

1. **Anthony & Sylvan's Weakness is Your Opportunity**: With 173+ BBB complaints and a 2.3-star Yelp rating, there's massive opportunity to position as the "anti-Anthony & Sylvan" - emphasizing warranty honoring, communication, and quality materials.

2. **Seasonal Timing is Critical**: Pool searches peak May-July but planning begins March-April. Launch aggressive SEO campaigns by February to capture the spring research phase.

3. **"Near Me" Keywords Dominate**: Local search intent is extremely high. Creating city-specific landing pages for each affluent neighborhood (Gladwyne, Villanova, Haverford, Hockessin, Greenville) will capture high-intent traffic.

4. **Cost Transparency Wins**: People search extensively for "how much does a pool cost" - being transparent about the $65K-$130K range builds trust and pre-qualifies leads.

5. **Plunge/Cocktail Pools Are Trending**: Perfect for smaller Main Line properties - this niche has less competition and appeals to the "luxury in less space" mindset of affluent buyers.

6. **Fiberglass Advantage in Pennsylvania Climate**: Freeze-thaw flexibility makes fiberglass ideal for PA/DE weather - a strong differentiator in content.

7. **Content Gap: Permit Guidance**: Few competitors offer comprehensive local permit guides. Creating township-specific permit guides creates link-worthy content.

8. **Warranty/Trust Content Needed**: Competitor complaints focus on warranty issues. Detailed warranty content and "what to ask your pool builder" guides position you as trustworthy.

9. **Financing Content Opportunity**: Pool financing is heavily searched but poorly explained by local builders. Comprehensive financing guides capture decision-stage traffic.

10. **Recurring Revenue Positioning**: Offering maintenance packages alongside installation creates long-term customer relationships and review opportunities.
