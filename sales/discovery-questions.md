## Discovery Philosophy

Great discovery isn't interrogation - it's a conversation. These questions should flow naturally, building on each other. Listen more than you talk. Take notes. Circle back to things they mention.

**The goal:** Understand their vision, constraints, timeline, and decision process so you can propose exactly what they need.
