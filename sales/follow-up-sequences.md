Hi [Name],

As you consider your pool project, I wanted to share something I tell every family: timing matters more than people realize.

Here's the reality:
- Spring is our busiest season
- Permit approval takes 2-4 weeks
- Installation takes 2-4 weeks
- Families who start in [month] typically swim by [month]

I'm not trying to rush you - just making sure timing is part of your planning.

Your quote is valid for 30 days, and I've reserved a tentative installation slot for you through [date].

Any questions about timeline?

### Touch 5: Day 10 - Addressing Unspoken Concerns

```
Subject: Is anything holding you back?

Hi [Name],

- Timeline questions? I can give you more detail
- Need to talk to someone else? I'm happy to meet with both of you
- Just need more time? That's perfectly fine

I hope you've been enjoying your pool! By now you've had a few weeks to settle into pool ownership.

I have a small favor to ask: if you know anyone who might be interested in transforming their backyard, I would be grateful for an introduction.

Pool projects come mostly from word-of-mouth referrals - families trusting recommendations from people they know. Your endorsement means more than any advertising I could do.

No pressure at all. But if someone comes to mind, I'd love to take great care of them the way I took care of you.

Thanks again for choosing Tri-State.

Brandon

P.S. - Everything still running smoothly? Let me know if you need anything.

If you've been happy with your pool experience (and I hope you have!), I have one more small ask: would you consider leaving a review?

Your story helps other families feel confident choosing Tri-State. A few sentences about your experience makes a real difference.

Here are the easy links:
- Google: [Direct link to Google review]
- Yelp: [Direct link to Yelp review]

Even a brief review is incredibly helpful. If you'd prefer, I'm happy to send you a few questions you can answer and I'll format it for you.

Thank you for considering it!

Brandon
```

Hi [Name],

Hard to believe it's been 3 months since we finished your pool! I wanted to check in and see how things are going.

Any questions about winterization prep? We're happy to help if you want to handle it yourself, or we offer closing services if you prefer hands-off.

Also, gentle reminder: if you know anyone thinking about a pool, I'd love an introduction. Referrals are the lifeblood of our business, and I promise to take great care of anyone you send our way.

Hope you've been making great memories in that backyard!

- Need any service or upgrades?

And as always, if you know anyone dreaming of their own backyard oasis, I'd be honored to help them.

Here's to many more summers of poolside memories!
