## Tri-State Aquatic Solutions

**Created:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Professional responses to common sales objections
**Approach:** Acknowledge, empathize, address, advance

---

## Objection Handling Framework

**A.E.A.A. Method:**
1. **Acknowledge** - Show you heard them
2. **Empathize** - Validate their concern
3. **Address** - Provide information/perspective
4. **Advance** - Move conversation forward

---

## Price Objections

### 1. "It's too expensive"

**Acknowledge:** "I hear you - this is a significant investment."

**Empathize:** "Every family has to weigh their priorities, and I respect that."

**Address:** "Let me share some perspective. Your quote includes:
- Premium [brand] equipment that lasts 15-20 years vs. 7-10 for standard
- A fiberglass shell with a lifetime structural warranty
- All permits, inspections, and professional installation
- My direct involvement throughout your project

Many homeowners find that what feels expensive upfront saves thousands over the life of the pool in maintenance, repairs, and energy costs."

**Advance:** "Can you help me understand what you were expecting to invest? Sometimes there are ways to adjust features while keeping the things that matter most to you."

---

### 2. "That's more than we budgeted"

**Acknowledge:** "I appreciate you being upfront about your budget."

**Empathize:** "It's smart to go in with a number in mind - that's good planning."

**Address:** "Let's look at this together. Where were you hoping to land?

[If close to their budget - within 15%:]
We're not far apart. Here are a few ways we could adjust:
- Different decking option: saves $[X]
- Standard equipment vs. premium: saves $[X]
- Smaller footprint pool: saves $[X]

[If significantly over budget - 20%+:]
To be honest with you, what you're describing typically costs in this range. I don't want to build something that doesn't meet your expectations. Would you be open to exploring:
- A plunge pool option that starts around $35-40K?
- A phased approach where we add features over time?
- Financing that spreads the investment comfortably?"

**Advance:** "What's most important to you in this project? Let's protect those priorities and see where we have flexibility."

---

### 3. "Your competitor is cheaper"

**Acknowledge:** "I'm not surprised - there's a wide range of pricing in this industry."

**Empathize:** "Getting the best value for your money is important. You should absolutely compare."

**Address:** "Here's what I'd encourage you to do: compare apples to apples. Ask both of us:
- What brand of equipment is included?
- Are all materials specified by name in the contract?
- What exactly is included vs. considered 'extra'?
- What's the warranty on shell, equipment, and labor?
- Who will be your contact throughout the project?

Sometimes a lower quote doesn't include things ours does. Sometimes it's genuinely less expensive. Either way, you deserve to know exactly what you're comparing."

**Advance:** "Would you like to walk through our quote together and identify any specific line items to compare?"

---

### 4. "Can you match their price?"

**Acknowledge:** "I understand you want the best value."

**Empathize:** "And you should absolutely negotiate - this is a major purchase."

**Address:** "Here's my honest answer: I could lower the price, but I'd have to cut something. Cheaper equipment. Less experienced crew. Less of my personal involvement. Those aren't cuts I'm willing to make.

Our pricing reflects:
- Premium materials I stand behind
- Crews I trust with my reputation
- A warranty I actually honor
- My direct involvement in your project

I compete on value, not just price. The companies that consistently win on price often struggle to deliver on everything else."

**Advance:** "If price is the deciding factor, I may not be the right fit. But if quality, communication, and long-term value matter, I believe we offer the best overall package. What matters most to you?"

---

## Timing Objections

### 5. "We need to think about it"

**Acknowledge:** "Absolutely - this isn't a decision to rush."

**Empathize:** "A pool is a major investment, and you should feel confident."

**Address:** "I want you to be 100% comfortable. To help your thinking:

Is there specific information you need that I haven't provided?
Is there a concern you haven't voiced that I might be able to address?
Is there someone else involved in this decision I should speak with?"

**Advance:** "Take the time you need. Can I check in with you [specific day] to see where you've landed? And if questions come up before then, you have my direct number."

---

### 6. "We're not ready yet"

**Acknowledge:** "I appreciate you being direct with me."

**Empathize:** "Timing is everything - there's no point starting a project if it doesn't fit your life right now."

**Address:** "Can I ask what's driving that timing? Is it:
- Financial - wanting to save more first?
- Life circumstances - other priorities right now?
- Uncertainty - still deciding if a pool is right for you?

Understanding helps me know how best to support you."

**Advance:** "When do you think the timing might be better? I'd like to stay in touch so when you're ready, you have a partner you already trust."

---

### 7. "Let's wait until spring"

**Acknowledge:** "Spring is when most people start thinking about pools."

**Empathize:** "It makes sense - that's when you're dreaming about summer."

**Address:** "Here's something to consider: spring is our busiest time. Families who wait until spring often end up swimming in July or August instead of June.

If we start the design and permitting process now, you'll be at the front of the line when installation season begins. You could be swimming by Memorial Day instead of Labor Day.

Starting now doesn't mean you pay now - it means you plan now and beat the rush."

**Advance:** "Would you like me to show you what the timeline looks like if we started the design process this month vs. waiting until spring?"

---

### 8. "We want to wait until after [event/season]"

**Acknowledge:** "That makes sense - [event] is clearly a priority."

**Empathize:** "You don't want construction chaos during [wedding/holidays/school year/etc.]."

**Address:** "Let me share some good news: we can plan around that. If we start the design and permitting now, we can schedule installation for right after [event]. You do the easy stuff now, and the construction happens when it's convenient.

Actually, many families prefer it this way - they get to enjoy [event] knowing their pool will be ready soon after."

**Advance:** "Would it make sense to get the planning out of the way now so you're not dealing with it during a busy time?"

---

## Decision-Maker Objections

### 9. "I need to talk to my spouse/partner"

**Acknowledge:** "Of course - this is absolutely a decision you should make together."

**Empathize:** "It wouldn't feel right moving forward without alignment."

**Address:** "I completely understand. A few options:
1. I can summarize everything in an email so you have it to review together
2. I'm happy to schedule a follow-up call or meeting when you're both available
3. If they have questions I can address now, feel free to give me a call

Is there anything specific you think they'll want to know that I can prepare for you?"

**Advance:** "When do you think you'll have a chance to discuss? I'll plan to follow up [specific day] to see if you have any questions."

---

### 10. "My spouse isn't convinced we need a pool"

**Acknowledge:** "That's a common dynamic - one person gets excited first."

**Empathize:** "Big decisions work best when both partners are on board."

**Address:** "If it would help, I'd be happy to have a conversation with both of you together. Sometimes the concerns someone has aren't about the pool itself - they're about the process, the cost, the maintenance, or the disruption.

Understanding their specific concerns helps me address them directly. Often it's something I can put to rest easily."

**Advance:** "Would it make sense for me to meet with both of you? No pressure - just a chance to answer questions and make sure you're both making the decision with complete information."

---

## Competition Objections

### 11. "We're getting other quotes"

**Acknowledge:** "Good - you absolutely should compare."

**Empathize:** "This is a significant investment, and due diligence is smart."

**Address:** "I welcome the comparison. When you're reviewing quotes, here are questions that reveal a lot:

- Is every material specified by brand, or are terms like 'quality coping' used?
- What's the payment schedule, and how does it align with work completed?
- Who is your contact, and can you reach them directly?
- What's the warranty process if something needs attention?
- Are there any common 'extras' that might increase the final price?

The answers will tell you how each company operates."

**Advance:** "When do you expect to make your decision? I want to make sure I'm available if questions come up as you compare. Feel free to call me anytime."

---

### 12. "We're leaning toward another company"

**Acknowledge:** "I appreciate you telling me that directly."

**Empathize:** "You clearly found something in their proposal that resonated."

**Address:** "Without asking you to reveal anything confidential, can you share what's drawing you to them?

Is it:
- Price? Let me see if there's room to adjust
- Features? Maybe we can match what they're offering
- Relationship? I want to understand what I could do better
- Reputation? Happy to connect you with our references"

**Advance:** "If there's anything I can do to earn your business, I'd like the opportunity. But if they're genuinely the better fit for you, I wish you well with your project."

---

### 13. "Anthony Sylvan has been around for 75 years"

**Acknowledge:** "They absolutely have history - there's no arguing with that."

**Empathize:** "Longevity suggests stability, and that matters."

**Address:** "Here's what I'd encourage you to consider: check recent reviews, not just the company history. Look at what customers in the last 1-2 years say about communication, warranty service, and follow-through.

Large companies have advantages - and they have challenges. The question is: which matters more to you?

With us, you get the owner on every project. You have my direct number. When something needs attention, I handle it personally - not a customer service department. That's a different experience."

**Advance:** "I'm not asking you to dismiss their history. I'm asking you to compare experiences. Would you like contact information for families we've worked with recently? Let them tell you what it's like."

---

### 14. "The other company has more reviews"

**Acknowledge:** "Review volume is definitely something to consider."

**Empathize:** "More reviews can feel more reassuring."

**Address:** "Here's another way to look at it: read the content of the reviews, not just the count.

A company that installs 500 pools a year will naturally have more reviews than one that installs 20. But what do those reviews actually say? Look for patterns:

- How do they handle problems?
- What do customers say about communication?
- Do people mention the owner, or is everything impersonal?

Our reviews may be fewer, but they're from families in your community who experienced what you're about to experience. Quality over quantity."

**Advance:** "Would you like me to connect you with a few recent customers directly? No scripts, no preparation - just honest conversations about their experience."

---

## Quality & Process Objections

### 15. "What if something goes wrong?"

**Acknowledge:** "That's a fair concern - things can happen on any construction project."

**Empathize:** "You want to know you're protected, and you should."

**Address:** "Here's how we handle it:

**During construction:** I'm personally involved in every project. If something isn't right, I catch it before it becomes your problem. And if an issue does arise, we address it immediately - not after weeks of phone tag.

**After completion:** Our warranty is straightforward:
- Lifetime structural warranty on the shell
- 3-year warranty on equipment
- 2-year warranty on workmanship

**The difference:** When you call with a warranty issue, you're calling me - not a 1-800 number. I don't have layers of approval to get something fixed. I just fix it."

**Advance:** "Would it help to speak with customers who've had us back for service? They can tell you firsthand how we handle things."

---

### 16. "What about maintenance costs?"

**Acknowledge:** "Smart question - the purchase price is just the beginning."

**Empathize:** "Long-term costs are something every pool owner should understand."

**Address:** "Let me break down typical annual costs:

**Chemicals:** $200-400/year (less with fiberglass - non-porous surface)
**Electricity:** $300-600/year (variable speed pumps cut this significantly)
**Opening/closing:** $400-600/year (if you hire it out)
**Routine maintenance:** $1,200-2,400/year (weekly service, optional)

**Total estimate:** $2,000-4,000/year depending on how hands-on you want to be.

**The fiberglass advantage:** Because the surface is smooth and non-porous, you need fewer chemicals, and algae has nowhere to grip. Our customers report 30-50% lower chemical costs vs. concrete pool owners.

**Equipment matters too:** The premium equipment we use consumes less energy and lasts longer - that's why we don't cut corners there."

**Advance:** "We offer maintenance packages if you want hands-off ownership. Would you like me to include that pricing in your proposal?"

---

### 17. "Fiberglass seems limiting - I want custom"

**Acknowledge:** "If maximum design flexibility is your priority, I understand the concern."

**Empathize:** "You want your pool to be exactly what you envision."

**Address:** "Let me show you what's possible with today's fiberglass options:

We have over 40 shell designs ranging from 10' plunge pools to 40'+ resort-style pools. Options include:
- Tanning ledges and sun shelves
- Built-in seating and benches
- Spillover spas
- Beach entries
- Various step configurations

What fiberglass doesn't do well: highly unusual shapes, infinity edges, very large estate pools.

What it does exceptionally: beautiful, functional residential pools with faster installation and lower lifetime maintenance.

For most families, fiberglass offers everything they want with significant advantages. For the 10% who need something truly custom, concrete is the answer."

**Advance:** "Let me show you the design options available. I think you'll be surprised by the variety. If nothing fits your vision, I'll be honest about that."

---

### 18. "The timeline seems too fast - is quality sacrificed?"

**Acknowledge:** "I understand the skepticism - 'fast' sometimes implies 'rushed.'"

**Empathize:** "You want quality, even if it takes longer."

**Address:** "Here's why fiberglass is faster without sacrificing quality:

**Traditional concrete pools:** The shell is built on-site, layer by layer. Each layer needs to cure. Weather delays compound. 3-6 months is standard.

**Fiberglass pools:** The shell is manufactured in a controlled factory environment over weeks of precision work. By the time it arrives, it's already perfect. We're not building the pool - we're installing a finished product.

The installation is fast because the manufacturing already happened. Quality isn't rushed - it's engineered."

**Advance:** "Would you like to see photos of the manufacturing process? It helps explain why the timeline is different."

---

## Financial Objections

### 19. "We can't afford the deposit right now"

**Acknowledge:** "Cash flow is a real consideration."

**Empathize:** "A 30% deposit is significant - I get it."

**Address:** "A few options to consider:

1. **Timing:** We can wait to start until a date that works for your finances. Lock in your design and pricing now, begin when you're ready.

2. **Financing:** Our financing partners can often cover the entire project, including the deposit. Monthly payments can start as low as $400.

3. **Phased deposit:** In some cases, we can structure a smaller initial deposit with the remainder due at excavation.

What would work best for your situation?"

**Advance:** "Let's find a way to make this work for you. What's the real constraint - timing of funds or total amount?"

---

### 20. "We're worried about financing/interest rates"

**Acknowledge:** "Interest rates definitely affect the total cost of ownership."

**Empathize:** "It's smart to factor that into your decision."

**Address:** "Let me share some perspective:

Current rates through our financing partners range from 7-11% depending on term and credit. On a $60,000 pool with a 10-year term at 9%, your monthly payment is around $760.

Two ways to think about this:

1. **Home equity comparison:** If you have equity, a HELOC may offer lower rates and tax-deductible interest. Worth exploring.

2. **Enjoyment value:** Every summer you wait is a summer without the pool. Interest costs money, but so does delaying the life you want to live.

3. **Home value:** Pools in our market typically add $25,000-$50,000 in home value. The equity gain partially offsets financing costs."

**Advance:** "Would you like me to connect you with our financing partner for a preliminary rate quote? No commitment - just information."

---

## Miscellaneous Objections

### 21. "We just bought the house - too soon for a big project"

**Acknowledge:** "Congratulations on the new home!"

**Empathize:** "There's a lot happening when you first move in."

**Address:** "Many families actually find this is the perfect time:

- You haven't landscaped yet, so there's nothing to tear up
- You're already thinking about how to use the space
- Construction mess blends with moving-in chaos
- You get to enjoy the pool from your first summer in the home

That said, if you need time to settle in, I completely understand. We're not going anywhere."

**Advance:** "Would it make sense to at least design what you want now, even if we delay construction a few months? That way you have a plan ready when you're ready."

---

### 22. "What about resale value? We might move."

**Acknowledge:** "Smart to think about the investment holistically."

**Empathize:** "You don't want to invest in something you can't recoup."

**Address:** "Here's what the data shows:

In our market (Main Line PA, Northern DE), pools are generally a positive for resale. Families with kids actively seek homes with pools. A well-maintained pool typically adds $25,000-$50,000 to home value.

The key is quality. A poorly maintained pool is a liability. A beautiful, low-maintenance fiberglass pool is an asset.

Also consider: you're not just investing in resale value. You're investing in summers with your family. What's that worth?"

**Advance:** "How long do you realistically expect to be in the home? If it's 3+ years, you'll likely get significant enjoyment and still see positive return when you sell."

---

### 23. "I've heard horror stories about pool companies"

**Acknowledge:** "Unfortunately, those stories exist - and they're not exaggerated."

**Empathize:** "You want to make sure you don't become one of those stories."

**Address:** "I'll be direct: the pool industry has earned some of its reputation. That's exactly why we operate differently:

- **Owner involvement:** I'm not a sales rep who disappears. I'm the owner, and I'm on your project.
- **Clear contracts:** Every material specified. Every cost itemized. No fine print tricks.
- **Responsive communication:** You have my cell phone. When you call, I answer.
- **Honest warranties:** When something needs attention, we fix it. No games.

I can't control what other companies do. I can only show you how we operate."

**Advance:** "Would you like to speak with families who had similar concerns before working with us? Hearing their experience might give you confidence."

---

### 24. "Our neighbors had a bad experience with a pool company"

**Acknowledge:** "That's unfortunate - and probably made you cautious."

**Empathize:** "Watching someone go through that definitely shapes how you approach it."

**Address:** "Do you know what specifically went wrong for them?

Common issues with other companies:
- Communication breakdown? We solve this with single-point-of-contact and weekly updates.
- Hidden costs? Our quotes are fully itemized - no surprises.
- Warranty disputes? Our warranty is straightforward and honored.
- Quality issues? We use premium materials and have my reputation on every job.

Whatever happened to your neighbors, let me show you how we'd prevent it."

**Advance:** "I'd actually be happy to talk with your neighbors if they'd find it helpful. Sometimes people in their situation have the best questions - they know what to watch out for."

---

### 25. "We're concerned about HOA approval"

**Acknowledge:** "HOA approval is definitely a factor in many neighborhoods."

**Empathize:** "You don't want to invest time and money in something that gets rejected."

**Address:** "We work with HOAs regularly. Here's our process:

1. Before finalizing your design, I'll review your HOA guidelines with you
2. We prepare professional documentation for submission
3. We can attend HOA meetings if needed
4. We design to comply with setback requirements, fence rules, and aesthetic guidelines

Most HOAs approve pool projects - they just want proper submission and compliance with community standards. We make that easy."

**Advance:** "Do you have a copy of your HOA guidelines? Let me review them before we finalize anything so we know exactly what we're working with."

---

### 26. "What about the mess and disruption?"

**Acknowledge:** "Construction is never completely clean - I won't pretend otherwise."

**Empathize:** "You live there, and you don't want weeks of chaos."

**Address:** "Here's what to realistically expect:

**Excavation (Day 1-2):** This is the messiest part. Heavy equipment, dirt piles, noise. We schedule this efficiently and remove spoils quickly.

**Installation (Days 3-7):** Pool shell arrives, gets set, backfilled. Traffic decreases significantly.

**Finishing (Days 8-14):** Plumbing, electrical, decking. Cleaner, more contained work.

**Total disruption:** About 2-3 weeks for fiberglass vs. 3-6 months for concrete.

We protect your property, communicate daily, and clean up after ourselves. Will there be some inconvenience? Yes. Will it be worth it? Absolutely."

**Advance:** "Would it help to see photos of projects in progress? You'll see how we manage the site."

---

### 27. "We have young kids - is it safe?"

**Acknowledge:** "Safety with kids is non-negotiable - I'm a parent too."

**Empathize:** "Your first job is keeping them safe."

**Address:** "Every pool installation includes discussion of safety measures:

**Barriers:**
- Pool fencing (often required by code) with self-closing, self-latching gates
- Pool covers (optional but recommended)
- Door and gate alarms

**Design features:**
- Gradual entry options (beach entry, steps)
- Bench seating in shallow areas
- Clear sightlines from the house

**Behavior:**
- Pool rules (always with adult supervision for young kids)
- Swimming lessons (we can recommend programs)

A pool with proper safeguards is not inherently dangerous. It's an opportunity to teach water safety in a controlled environment."

**Advance:** "Would you like me to include safety feature options in your proposal? We can design with your kids' ages specifically in mind."
