## Executive Summary

Dear [Client Name],

Thank you for the opportunity to design your backyard retreat. Following our consultation on [date], I'm pleased to present a custom pool design tailored to your vision, property, and lifestyle.

### Your Vision
[Summarize what they told you they wanted - in their words where possible]

*Example: "You shared that your primary goal is creating a space for your family to gather and make memories. With two kids under 10, safety and fun are priorities, and you'd love a tanning ledge where you can relax while watching them swim. You're also interested in minimal maintenance so you can enjoy the pool rather than work on it."*

### Property Assessment
[Summary of yard evaluation]

*Example: "Your property at [address] offers excellent pool potential. The relatively flat backyard, southern exposure for sun, and clear access from the side yard make installation straightforward. We'll position the pool to maximize afternoon sun while maintaining sightlines from your kitchen and family room."*

### Recommended Solution
[One-paragraph summary of what you're proposing]

*Example: "Based on your priorities, I recommend a 16' x 32' rectangular fiberglass pool with integrated tanning ledge, bench seating in the shallow end, and LED lighting for evening enjoyment. This design optimizes your space while delivering the features that matter most to your family."*
