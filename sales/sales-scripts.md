## 1. Initial Phone Inquiry Script

### When the Phone Rings

**Opening (within 3 rings):**

"Good [morning/afternoon], this is Brandon with Tri-State Aquatic Solutions. Thanks for calling - how can I help you today?"

### Handling Common Opening Questions

**"How much does a pool cost?"**

"Great question - I'd love to give you an accurate number. Pool investments typically range from $45,000 to $100,000 depending on size, features, and your specific property. To give you a meaningful estimate, I'd need to understand a bit more about what you're envisioning. Do you have a few minutes?"

[If yes, continue with discovery questions]

**"Do you install fiberglass pools?"**

"Absolutely - fiberglass is actually our specialty. We believe it offers the best combination of quality, speed, and long-term value for most homeowners. What got you interested in fiberglass specifically?"

**"Are you available this summer?"**

"We're currently booking spring and early summer installations. The earlier we start the design process, the better position you'll be in for summer enjoyment. Have you already begun planning, or are you just starting to explore?"

### Initial Discovery (2-3 minutes)

"Before I take any more of your time, let me ask a few quick questions to make sure I can actually help you..."

1. "Where is your home located?" [Confirm within service area]

2. "What's prompting you to think about a pool right now?" [Understand motivation]

3. "Do you have a general sense of what style or size you're envisioning?" [Qualify expectations]

4. "Have you spoken with any other pool companies yet?" [Competitive intelligence]

### Transition to Appointment

"Based on what you've shared, it sounds like we could definitely help. The best next step would be for me to come out to your property - I can see your backyard, understand your vision, and give you real numbers based on your specific situation. There's no cost and no obligation. Does that sound reasonable?"

### Scheduling the Consultation

"I have availability [offer 2-3 options within next 7 days]. What works better for your schedule?"

[After selecting time]

"Perfect. Let me confirm: I'll see you at [address] on [day] at [time]. I'll send you a confirmation email with my contact information. If anything comes up, you can reach me directly at 610-870-3113."

### Closing the Call

"Is there anything specific you'd like me to prepare or bring to our meeting?"

[Wait for response]

"Great. I'm looking forward to seeing your backyard and discussing what's possible. Have a great [day/evening], [Name]."

## 2. Consultation Appointment Setting Script

### Outbound Call to Warm Lead

**Opening:**

"Hi [Name], this is Brandon Calloway from Tri-State Aquatic Solutions. You [downloaded our pool guide / submitted a request on our website / were referred by ___]. Is this a good time for a quick call?"

[If no] "No problem at all. When would be a better time to catch you?"

[If yes] "Great, I'll keep this brief..."

### Qualifying and Setting Appointment

"I saw you were interested in [pool type / general information]. I'd love to learn more about what you have in mind.

First, a quick question - is adding a pool something you're actively planning for this year, or are you more in the early research phase?"

**If actively planning:**

"Perfect timing. The best way for me to help is to see your property in person. I can assess your backyard, discuss your vision, and give you realistic numbers - all at no cost. Would sometime this week or next work for a quick visit?"

**If early research:**

"That's completely understandable - it's a big decision. Even in the research phase, a quick property visit can help. You'll get a sense of what's actually possible in your space and what a realistic budget might look like. No pressure, just information to help your planning. Would that be helpful?"

### Handling Scheduling Hesitation

**"I'm not ready yet":**

"I completely understand. Many families like to gather information before committing to meetings. What would be most helpful for you right now - more information on pricing, the process, or something else?"

**"Can you just give me a ballpark over the phone?"**

"I wish I could give you an accurate number without seeing your property, but every backyard is different - access, soil conditions, slope, existing landscaping. A phone estimate could be off by $10,000 or more. The consultation takes about 30-45 minutes, and you'll leave with real information you can use. Would [date/time] work?"

**"I'm getting multiple quotes":**

"That's smart - you absolutely should compare. I'd welcome the chance to be one of the companies you consider. What I can promise is a detailed, transparent quote with no hidden costs. When are you meeting with the others? I can work around their schedule."

### Confirmation

"Excellent. I have you down for [day], [date] at [time] at [address]. I'll send a confirmation email with my direct contact information. Plan for about 45 minutes. Any questions before we meet?"

## 3. On-Site Consultation Walkthrough

### Arrival (First 5 Minutes)

**Approach:**
- Arrive 2-3 minutes early
- Park on street, not in driveway (unless invited)
- Have business card, notepad, and measuring tools ready
- Dress professionally but appropriately for walking a yard

**Greeting:**

"[Name]? Brandon Calloway - great to meet you in person. Thanks for having me out today."

[Handshake, make eye contact, smile]

"Beautiful [home/property/neighborhood]. How long have you lived here?"

[Brief small talk to build rapport - 2-3 minutes max]

### Transition to Business

"Well, I'm excited to see your backyard and hear what you're envisioning. Should we head back?"

### The Backyard Walk (15-20 Minutes)

**Initial Assessment (observe silently for 30 seconds):**

Take in the space. Note:
- Overall size and shape
- Existing landscaping
- Slopes or grades
- Sun exposure
- Proximity to house
- Fence/privacy situation
- Access for equipment

**Opening Question:**

"So, tell me - when you picture yourself out here with a pool, what do you see?"

[Let them talk. Take notes. Ask follow-up questions based on their vision.]

**Discovery Questions to Weave In:**

- "Who will be using the pool most? Kids, entertaining adults, fitness?"
- "How important is low maintenance to you?"
- "Have you thought about any specific features - spa, tanning ledge, water features?"
- "Are there any concerns about your yard you'd like me to address?"
- "What's your general timeline - hoping to swim this summer?"

**Education (while walking):**

"Based on your space, here's what I'm seeing..."

- Point out optimal pool placement
- Explain why certain locations work better
- Note any challenges and how you'd address them
- Share relevant examples from similar projects

**Fiberglass Education:**

"Have you had a chance to learn about the differences between fiberglass and concrete pools?"

[If no, provide brief education:]

"Let me give you the quick version. Fiberglass pools install in 2-4 weeks versus 3-6 months for concrete. The surface is smooth and non-porous, so it needs fewer chemicals and less maintenance. And because the shell is manufactured in controlled conditions, quality is incredibly consistent. For most residential applications, it's the smarter investment."

### Indoor Discussion (15-20 Minutes)

**Transition:**

"I've seen what I need to see. Do you mind if we sit down for a few minutes to discuss options and answer your questions?"

**At the Kitchen Table:**

1. **Summarize what you heard:**
   "Let me make sure I understand what's most important to you..."
   [Recap their priorities]

2. **Present initial concepts:**
   "Based on your yard and what you've described, here's what I'd recommend..."
   [Sketch rough concepts, discuss pool sizes/shapes that fit]

3. **Address budget:**
   "Have you thought about a budget range for this project?"

   [If they share a number, respond honestly:]
   "That's a realistic budget for what we've discussed" OR
   "To be transparent, what you're describing typically runs a bit higher than that. Let me show you some options that would fit your budget, and we can discuss what it would take to achieve your full vision."

4. **Explain your process:**
   "Here's how we work..."
   - Free design consultation (today)
   - Custom 3D design and detailed proposal (5-7 days)
   - Review meeting to finalize details
   - Contract signing and deposit
   - Permits (2-4 weeks)
   - Installation (2-4 weeks)
   - Final walkthrough and pool school

5. **Set expectations:**
   "I'll put together a custom design and detailed proposal for you. Everything will be itemized - every material by brand, every cost explained. No surprises. You'll have the complete picture to make your decision."

### Closing the Consultation

**Next Steps:**

"Here's what happens next: Within the next 5-7 days, I'll send you a complete proposal package including a 3D rendering of your pool, detailed specifications, and line-item pricing. Then we'll schedule a time to review everything together. Does that work for you?"

**Addressing Concerns:**

"Before I go, is there anything that concerns you or any questions I haven't answered?"

[Address whatever they raise]

**Final Impression:**

"[Name], I really appreciate you taking the time today. Your backyard has great potential, and I'm excited to show you what we can create. You'll hear from me within [X] days."

[Handshake, leave business card if not already given]

## 4. Quote Presentation Script

### Setting Up the Meeting

**By phone or email:**

"Hi [Name], great news - your custom pool design is complete, and I think you're going to love it. I'd like to walk you through everything in person so I can answer questions and make sure everything is exactly what you envisioned. Do you have about 45 minutes to meet [offer 2-3 times]?"

### Presentation Structure

**Opening (5 minutes):**

"Thanks for making time to meet. Before I show you the design, let me recap what I heard during our consultation to make sure I captured everything..."

[Summarize their priorities, concerns, and must-haves]

"Does that still accurately reflect what you're looking for?"

[Present 3D rendering - ideally on tablet or laptop]

Walk through:
- Overall design and why it fits their space
- Specific features they requested
- How design addresses any concerns discussed
- Material selections and why you chose them

"What's your first impression?"

[Listen. Adjust tone based on their reaction]

**Handling Design Feedback:**

"I'm so glad. Let me walk you through the details..."

If they're uncertain:
"Tell me what you're thinking. What would make this feel exactly right?"

If they want changes:
"Absolutely - that's easy to adjust. Here's how that would work..."

**The Investment (10 minutes):**

"Now let's talk about the investment. I've prepared a detailed proposal with every cost itemized..."

[Walk through proposal line by line]

Key talking points:

- "This price includes everything we discussed - no surprises or change orders"
- "I've separated the base pool from optional features so you can see exactly what each element costs"

**State the total clearly:**

[Pause. Let them absorb. Don't fill the silence.]

### Closing the Presentation

**Check for understanding:**

"What questions do you have about any of this?"

[Answer thoroughly]

**Test the waters:**

"How does this compare to what you were expecting?"

**If positive response:**

"Based on our conversation, this seems like a great fit for your family. The next step would be signing the agreement and submitting the deposit to lock in your installation slot. Are you ready to move forward, or do you need some time to discuss?"

**If hesitation:**

"I can tell you're thinking it through - that's completely appropriate for a decision this size. What would help you feel confident moving forward?"

[Address specific concerns - see Objection Handling Guide]

**If not ready:**

"I understand. This is your timeline, not mine. Let me leave this proposal with you. It's valid for 30 days, and I'm available whenever questions come up. When should I check back in with you?"

### Quote Expiration Follow-Up (Day 25-30)

**Purpose:** Create urgency, final opportunity before requoting

"Hi [Name], it's Brandon. I wanted to reach out because your proposal is approaching the 30-day mark. Material costs can fluctuate, so I wanted to give you a heads up before I'd need to requote. Is there anything I can do to help you finalize your decision this week?"

### Lost Deal Re-Engagement (60+ days)

**Purpose:** Understand why, leave door open, learn for improvement

"Hi [Name], it's Brandon from Tri-State. I know it's been a while since we last talked about your pool project. I wanted to check in - did you end up moving forward with another company, or is the project still on your radar?"
