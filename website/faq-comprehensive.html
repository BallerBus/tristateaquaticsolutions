                            <p>Most pool financing requires a credit score of 640+ for the best rates, though options exist for scores as low as 580. Credit scores of 720+ typically qualify for the lowest interest rates (6-8% APR). Scores of 640-719 usually see rates of 8-12% APR.</p>

                            <p>Interest on home equity loans used for home improvements like pools may be tax-deductible if you itemize deductions and the loan is secured by your home. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 limited this deduction, so consult your tax advisor for current rules.</p>
                            <p>Unsecured pool loans typically are not tax-deductible. The potential tax benefit can make home equity financing more attractive for qualifying homeowners. Learn more on our <a href="/financing/">financing page</a>.</p>
